The point in my answer wasn't about how slow or fast your site will be...I was simply stating that as long as the cron executes, then it is doing its job. There is not a lot you can do to make it execute faster or to make your site run faster on a shared server...you are pretty much at the mercy of the server and all the other accounts on that server. I'm not sure if there is a way to check out performance on a shared server (other than ping test and so forth)\u00a0before setting up your account. One thing is for sure (at least from my experience), if you are on a low cost, shared server with hundreds of other sites, then your site is going to be slow at least during times when there is a lot of use on that server by other accounts. For example, I have a bluehost account that I use for testing 1.6. I have several production sites on a dedicated server (dual opetron 242 processors and 4 gig of RAM).

I noticed Bluehost answer phone very quickly if you call for their \u201csales\u201d department and for the most part, each salesman I\u2019ve talked to is very nice and also the tech department people.\r\n        However, Bluehost has really kept me busy with their very slow servers causing not only extremely slow page load times, but \u201cserver time out\u201d error messages and at least 1 server downtime per month. (and I only look at the site for a few hours per week, due to the frustration of not being able to upload/add to the site due to its extremely slow page load wait times).\r\n        I also found it extremely frustrating after about 2 months on the cloud and several server downtimes and calls to Bluehost tech support, the salesman/tech suggestion to solve the problem was for me to pay more money.\r\n        I tried the basic \u201cshared\u201d plan for several months, the so called better performing and more expensive \u201ccloud\u201d plan for several months and I actually experienced faster page load times with the less expensive \u201cshared\u201d plan and about 1/5 the downtime. Each time I was scheduled to \u201cmigrate\u201d hosting plans, \u201cThere was a problem in completing the request\u201d and spent several hours frantically trying to communicate with Bluehost chat and on hold over the phone. While on the cloud, my emails were completely inaccessible, for several days, and I was told an outside tech had to be called. Their recommendation to me was to use \u201cgmail\u201d instead. It seems Bluehost is best as a \u201csales\u201d company at the moment instead of providing fast website page load times, so people can grow their data storage and legitimately grow and upgrade their hosting plans. The Bluehost chat is often times a nightmare to deal with, whether the chat program works at all after 15 minutes and more wait times or freezes as it did with me several times.\r\n        I don\u2019t know where the chat people are from, but from names like \u201cShubhashree J\u201d, I assume it is not the U.S.. Not only do the chat session people disconnect a session with barely a moments notice, but they will take 30 minutes or more to respond to a previous statement of \u201cPlease allow the next agent a few moments to review the chat and become familiar with your issue\u201d. When the chat people do make statements, they are along the lines of \u201c. . . in the shared hosting service and in normal basis the average time to connect to the website is 5-15 seconds\u201d. Really 15 seconds? I never saw any ecommerce or other type of website which took 15 seconds to load, and mine was actually taking about 5-15 seconds to load, often times more. Even Bluehost cpanel login and webmail takes long to load at least compared to yahoo mail or hotmail. I can\u2019t say how good or bad other web host companies are, because I have only experienced one other, which is GoDaddy and although I never had any major problem with Godaddy I can recall, the only reason why I chose \u201cBluehost\u201d was because my website developer recommended it and so I thought I must use Bluehost otherwise my developer would always blame me and Godaddy or any other hosting company for any problems.\r\n        Turns out Bluehost blames the site developer and the site developer blames Bluehost for any problems anyway. Although my other site with Godaddy is small in comparison, the speed of the Godaddy site is so much faster, I literally cannot even count the 1 Mississippi before the page loads. Considering the millions and billions of pages on the internet, why is it that Bluehost seems to have so many problems with my few dozen web pages? Am I one of the few unlucky ones or is any website with more than a few pages not compatible with Bluehost hosting performance anymore? Is there a site storage size, where Bluehost is no longer viable for fast page load times? Am I correct in assuming that Bluehost is not a hosting company for any website with a desire for growth in sales?

There is no telephone number to contact. Why they didn`t do this when I purchased the service is a mystery.

I decided to go with Kodi, which is open source streaming software. I quickly found out that many of the shows I wanted to watch were IP blocked, and I didn\u2019t reside in the country they serviced.\nSo, off I went looking for a VPN provider so I wouldn\u2019t be geo blocked due to my IP address. After reviewing many of the more popular services, I decided to go with ExpressVPN based on the price and the 24/7 service, as well as the vast selection of countries to choose from.\nThey had a very simple app to download from the Google Play store, which I needed because I am not the most tech savvy person. After downloading the app, all I had to do was click a green button on it and instantly my IP was changed! It was incredibly easy to change my IP location to virtually any country in the world with just the click of the very simply stated \u201cchoose location\u201d button right next to the button to turn the service on. When I went looking to see what other locations they had, the interface was broken down by continents, each with many, many countries in its list and many different IP addresses to choose from within each country\nAfter some time of using it, I noticed the connections were always solid with no drops and amazing speeds. I often found ExpressVPN provided an even more solid connection than my own home connection most of the time!\nWhen I needed technical help setting up an IP address on a smart tv, customer service was there within a minute and walked me through each step, and waited to make sure I had everything up and running. The customer service is stellar, and made me very impressed with the company as a whole\nI was so impressed with the service that I changed my monthly plan, which was 12.95 per month, to pay for a year outright and was taken down to 8.32 per month for the service! For the options it provides, the speeds and quality, and the outstanding customer service, it\u2019s the best 100 dollars a year I\u2019ve spent\n                    "]}, "https://www.bestvpn.com/expressvpn-review/[105]": {"url": "https://www.bestvpn.com/expressvpn-review/", "ratings": 8.2, "review": ["\n\t\t\t\t\tHi again Douglas.

We started using Bluehost about 5 years ago to host a few of our company websites. Things were fine. Then we added more websites, as well as our company email. In the last few months, we noticed our websites would go blank during the day. No explanation from Bluehost as to why it was happening \u2013 you would think they might contact us and inform us of the problem, and offer some solutions. We had to contact them \u2013 their suggestion was to move to a dedicated host because our website traffic was too large for a shared server. So we migrated. Apparently Bluehost does zero backups, and we lost a lot of valuable emails in the process. They also removed our SSL certificate, and told us it would cost $149/yr per site to get it back (we host about 20 sites). It also altered our ability to upload media files to our websites via wordpress, adversely limiting our ability to do work on our websites. Their answer is to use FTP \u2013 however, when you have 10 people who work on your websites and are familiar with WordPress, there is a learning curve to FTP.\r\n        Long story short, Bluehost caused a HUGE disruption to our business.

My previous VPN vendor\u2019s Windows app had endless options and whenever you reported a problem to them their first response was to have you try turning each one on or off to see how it affected the problem. Extensive testing required that I wasn\u2019t willing to do for them \u2013 so my last problem before I left them wasn\u2019t resolved.\nFrom my initial experience, ExpressVPN is working well for me on my Chromebook and Android tablet with a few very minor hiccups but appears somewhat more flaky on my Windows PC. I am able to access certain financial web sites with ExpressVPN that I couldn\u2019t with my former VPN software, nicely enough. Their web site is polished and professional. I have generally decided though that you just have to expect more problem issues/complexity if you introduce a VPN to the mix. AND the prices quoted for the software are US$ !\nExpressVPN support is fairly quick and friendly but fairly knee-jerk unthinking. They seem to want to have you first try re-installing the software as an attempt at resolution for any problem.

I got the answer direct from the ExpressVPN people. Here\u2019s what I did.\nExpressVPN customer support was, in the end, very precise, efficient, and well\u2026savvy.\nExpressVPN support also supplied (true to their name) an express way to remove the existing program with one command line entered into the terminal. Neat\u2026!\nThen they simply had me upgrade from v-6.5 to v-6.7.1 and that too, was with one express URL and a new Authorization code. Most companies don\u2019t do that. Translation: savvy customer support. \nSince I installed v-6.7.1, my CPU cycles for expressvpnd dropped from 98% to 0.1%. Uhhh\u2026.wow.\nThe only place what I am saying, compared with what you\u2019re saying, differs, is that after my upgrade installation to v-6.7.1, my Activity Monitor shows three files running (couldn\u2019t find a way to upload a png screenshot) with these %-age CPU cycles :\n ExpressVPN\t                                0.4%\t(main program)\n expressvpn-browser-helper\t0.0\t        (I installed their browser helper, so this is known)\n expressvpnd\t                        0.3\t        (I have no idea what this is or what it does)\nSo it\u2019s a mystery why your Mac installation shows no expressvpnd file. Anybody there know what that\u2019s about?\nIncidentally, Douglas, unlike two people on this thread complaining about crashing or major loss of speed, my installation is rock-steady for hours and hours day after day. Reliability is one of the things I like most about ExpressVNP and IPVanish. I run both. They\u2019re both great tools I\u2019ve been using them for about a year or more.\nThe good news is ExpressVPN is running a small footprint.\nLASTLY, I value your site highly for your rigorous checking, comparisons, and reviews.

They started out being fantastic and, for people whose needs are basic, they probably still are. But as my needs grew more complex, their ability to provide the support I needed began to decline steadily. What has generated the most degradation of my trust in Bluehost is their lack of transparency and poor communication. Got a specific sort of question about this feature or that feature on their service? Well, expect to find only vague mentions of particulars on their website. They write down as little of their technical policies and as few of their technical features in detail as they possibly can. Instead, you have to call them for particulars\u2026 and over the years you\u2019ll learn from their agents about all sorts of disappointing policies and feature limitations that are astoundingly absent on their actual written documentation and advertising material. Transparency is not Bluehost\u2019s strong suit and, not to be overly pessimistic, but I think that\u2019s by design so that they rescind or limit the various features of their service as much as possible and not have to be held accountable for it. The less they promise explicitly, the more value they can quietly withhold from you\u2026 until one day your needs expand to demand that value you thought you had already paid for and they can say,\u201d Sorry, that feature is only included to a limited degree in your package\u2026 if you want more, you\u2019ll need to upgrade to so-and-so level or buy so-and-so add-on.\u201d Communication also leaves a lot to be desired. If there\u2019s a problem with your site, you absolutely will not get any helpful notifications from them. Nothing. Back before I got a dedicated IP, my sites and email just randomly stopped working: turned out that my shared IP had been involved in a DDoS attack and everything had been shut down. If I hadn\u2019t noticed my sites and email stop working and called them to ask what was happening, I never would\u2019ve heard about it. Fast forward 3 or 4 years and botch up SSL certs on my website, leaving a subdomain throwing an SSL error. Guess what? Never got a single notification from them. They have your email on file\u2026 they have no problem sending you messages to ask you to renew your service\u2026 but automate emails to alert you of service interruptions or security issues? Nope. You\u2019re on your own, buddy\u2026 you call them for the privilege of knowing how they\u2019ve are dropped the ball\u2026 they don\u2019t just hand out damning info like that. Again\u2026 good for the most basic needs, but as your needs increase, you\u2019ll start seeing all of the corners they cut and all of the \u201cfeatures\u201d that they\u2019ve limited in bizarre ways to strong-arm you into spending more and more and more.

My class was going along fine for a couple of months and then all the sudded I was booted from the server. My problem was caused by students on the discussion forum. In a nutshell, here is what caused my problem....In\u00a0an online two-week long module, I upload several discussion questions\u00a0(started threads) to a forum on a Thursday. Students have until midnight on Sunday to read and post their initial replies to the starter threads and we discuss these throughout the two\u00a0week period.\u00a0Of course, some students do them immediatley, but several wait until the last minute. What happened in my case was that several students waited until Sunday evening to post their initial responses...so I had a lot of activity (10 to 15 students)\u00a0on the discussion board on Sunday evening. Evidently, a tech person saw this activity (demand on the processor) and booted me from the server. As you can see in my posts about this, it caused some major problems for me in that class.The ironic part is that this wasn't my first online module....I had been doing this for two months prior to being booted from the server. I'm now on a dedicated server with dual opteron processors and 4 gig of RAM and I've watched the server load move into the red (over 2.0) briefly when just a few people are using the discussion baord, but it has never caused a problem. I'm pretty sure that is what happened on my shared account...the load spiked briefly...they either saw it when it happened or saw it in the logs and booted me from the server.
