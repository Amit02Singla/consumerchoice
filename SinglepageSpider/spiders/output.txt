I would definitely recommend Bluehost as your hosting provider because of the excellent features they give that other hosting providers can’t. Whenever you have a problem, customer support is very important and they give 24/7 round the clock support so no need to worry. Although their pricing is cheap than other providers, ‘reliability’ of their servers are outstanding! And the feature that I liked most is their user-friendly control panel. Right from creating your account ’til hosting setup, the process is sure easy to understand and you would complete it in minutes.++++++++++++++
Count me a satisfied customer. This website is the oldest of the four I’ve hosted at Bluehost since 2010 — and I wouldn’t dream of moving any of them. They are cost-competive and service oriented. By the numbers:++++++++++++++

1. Account services and maintenance has always been excellent. They were good to work with setting the accounts up, and were very good helping me set up the best value package to meet our needs,++++++++++++++

2. Security is a strong point. I appreciate their diligence in protecting my asset. I would characterize them as an optimal mix of strong procedures and realistic administration.++++++++++++++

3. Tech support– Has been top of the line — knowledgeable, good listeners, patient, and understanding, excellent communicators.++++++++++++++
I have hosted seven of my customer’s websites on Bluehost for nearly ten years. Not once during that time have my clients lost one minute of hosting service for any reason. Part of the reason for that I believe is because of the periodic updating of their servers. Bluehost appears to be operating and meticulously maintaining state of the art servers. Another factor in Bluehost’s outstanding performance in the quality and skill of the technical support representatives. When I have had a question about online renewal of my customers domain licenses or hosting or file uploads I can confidently tell my customers that I will have an answer for their questions in a matter of minutes. My confidence in Bluehost technical support was developed over those same seven years in never once having to wait for my call to be picked-up, never once having a support person provide an incorrect answer or solution to a request, never once having to ask a representative if they could transfer me to someone who spoke English. I will always reward a vendor that provides this level of service and this level of professional integrity, with my loyalty.++++++++++++++
I switched TO Blue Host a few months ago after having had Justhost.com and then Ipage.com as hosting companies I used for years switching both times because their customer service went way downhill.++++++++++++++
Tech support answers the phone quickly, but is trained to blame your code for any outage or issue with their web hosting servers. The agents answering the tech support lines have very substandard technical knowledge and don’t expect them to help with any technical issue.++++++++++++++

I started with a plain shared website. Performance was horrible. Was upsold on a more expensive plan, improved somewhat but ended up with a another upsell just to move my site to another server because support was unwilling to help with issue that was plaguing the old server. After a couple month of trouble free time on the new cloud server, issues started popping up again. Frequent server down times or restarts, random reverse proxy or load ballancer timeouts. As soon as I can find a block of time to migrate my web site I am leaving.++++++++++++++
Signed up with bluehost couple of years ago, been happy ever since, site runs smoothly support is helpful. I do want to say that I did not expect the renewal price to be higher than what I paid initially; I did look up renewal pricing with other web host, it turned out that they all charge a higher renewal price; I stayed with Bluehost where I remained happy.++++++++++++++
Just got off a call with Joe from support, been working on launching the site, and he was super helpful. As a person that had no clue how to set up a website it was really important for me to find a company with affordable pricing, one that has helpful resources, and great support. When i first wanted to start my websites, i search how to set up my blog and found lots of resources on how to do it on bluehost; when i encountered issues installing a theme i contacted support and they were really helpful. The rep was nice enough that he suggested couple of plugin to help me with my SEO stuff. So far been really happy with bluehost!++++++++++++++
I have been with Bluehost for 6 years now and I cannot be happier; the initial pricing that I signed up for was very reasonable, I still remember price shopping around and noticed that Bluehost was recommended by many influencers in the industry; they are also the top recommended host on WordPress; going with them was for sure the right choice. I love how they do the auto update for my WordPress site, i have had an issue with a couple of bad plugins, but with the current auto update, things cannot be more secure. I learned that they recently started offering free SSL, soon i will be selling a couple of products on my site, having the free SSL cannot be better.++++++++++++++
What a mess! BlueHost. After charging $250 for a year of service (which included cloud) they wanted another $150 to migrate my web site…. and it doesn’t stop there with fees.++++++++++++++
Stay away from a guy named Eddie in VPS sales. He is completely incompetent. He can not read the most basic information on your account. He makes statements like, “I don’t see you have VPS in your account.” and then after trying to tell him that the account is VPS, he will apologize and say . he “made a mistake”. Then we ask to speak to his supervisor and he refuses unless you give him a reason why. Then after you explain why, he puts you on hold and sais, his manager named “Bret is so busy, he doesn’t have time to come to the phone”. On top of all that, Bluehost Cpanel and hosting is so incredibly slow to load, it’s a small miracle we have any sales. It literally takes our Bluehost Cpanel minutes to fully load page information. Our website page load speeds are by far the slowest to load of all our competitor websites and we have a very simple website compared to others. We are counting the days until we can find another domain hosting company. Bluehost had 1 or 2 employees who were knowledgeable a few years ago, but now they are gone and anyone a little decent is impossible to talk to.++++++++++++++
I’ve been with Bluehost for quite some time now, maybe 8 years I think. They started out being fantastic and, for people whose needs are basic, they probably still are. But as my needs grew more complex, their ability to provide the support I needed began to decline steadily. What has generated the most degradation of my trust in Bluehost is their lack of transparency and poor communication. Got a specific sort of question about this feature or that feature on their service? Well, expect to find only vague mentions of particulars on their website. They write down as little of their technical policies and as few of their technical features in detail as they possibly can. Instead, you have to call them for particulars… and over the years you’ll learn from their agents about all sorts of disappointing policies and feature limitations that are astoundingly absent on their actual written documentation and advertising material. Transparency is not Bluehost’s strong suit and, not to be overly pessimistic, but I think that’s by design so that they rescind or limit the various features of their service as much as possible and not have to be held accountable for it. The less they promise explicitly, the more value they can quietly withhold from you… until one day your needs expand to demand that value you thought you had already paid for and they can say,” Sorry, that feature is only included to a limited degree in your package… if you want more, you’ll need to upgrade to so-and-so level or buy so-and-so add-on.” Communication also leaves a lot to be desired. If there’s a problem with your site, you absolutely will not get any helpful notifications from them. Nothing. Back before I got a dedicated IP, my sites and email just randomly stopped working: turned out that my shared IP had been involved in a DDoS attack and everything had been shut down. If I hadn’t noticed my sites and email stop working and called them to ask what was happening, I never would’ve heard about it. Fast forward 3 or 4 years and botch up SSL certs on my website, leaving a subdomain throwing an SSL error. Guess what? Never got a single notification from them. They have your email on file… they have no problem sending you messages to ask you to renew your service… but automate emails to alert you of service interruptions or security issues? Nope. You’re on your own, buddy… you call them for the privilege of knowing how they’ve are dropped the ball… they don’t just hand out damning info like that. Again… good for the most basic needs, but as your needs increase, you’ll start seeing all of the corners they cut and all of the “features” that they’ve limited in bizarre ways to strong-arm you into spending more and more and more. Beware.++++++++++++++
Obtained a free SSL with my package, which renewed a couple of times. Then the next time they took down my site. Spent the whole day on the phone to them with no help at all. They made me phone Comodo who referred me back to them. Then they redirected my site to a non-associated third party site. All of this was done with extreme arroganace and no help whatsoever!++++++++++++++
The support is extremely slow – even when it says “Five min” it may take an hour. The staff are clueless and you end up having to explain the issue again and again, and MAYBE, just maybe they will understand after 30 min or so.++++++++++++++
The account was deactivated for suspicious activity. Please send a copy of 1. A government-issued ID showing the name of the account owner, 2. Some form of official documentation substantiating address, such as a utility bill in hard copy, or other business/personal documents to verification@bluehost.com to reactivate the account.++++++++++++++
I used their VPS for a few years with some problems (had to solve lots of them my own). Uptime was good, speed was mediocre and apps were working good but if you have a problem their staff cannot solve and just tell try this try that.++++++++++++++
Bluehost is fine like you say, but it didn’t work for me. I decide on a refund and I had checked out the details under refund. “Bluehost will deduct a non-refundable domain fee of 15.99 from your refund.” which is fair enough, but they also opted me in for privacy, which I didn’t notice and didn’t require since I was just testing, so I was charged extra for that. They argue the small prints made it clear, but the line++++++++++++++
They charge you a full year minimum up-front, try to upsell you every time you attempt to get customer service, and then they randomly delete email history and disconnect DB connections to WordPress sites.++++++++++++++
the emails were working today and all of a sudden after 9AM PST, the emails stopped working. So I contacted bluehost to find out what’s going on. I logged into the account and check as well. i went into the email area and found that all the emails on the account is gone. WTF! I’m with the agent chatting and it’s now 10:31AM PST and still no answer as to what happened and what is going on.++++++++++++++
Bluehosts technical support is incompetent. Every time I call the technician tells me something different than the previous employee. I’ve worked with 7 different technicians, they’ve literally all given me different answers, which I wouldn’t even say have been answers because I still have to call them day after day to resolve a domain issue after I’ve registered my domain with them for 10 years. (over $300) This company is awful, the employees aren’t focused on solving problems, they’re only focused on turning over calls.++++++++++++++
Most recently I have been on the phone with 6 different agents on the phone and on chat in 7 days. I still don’t have email that is working for my site. I have an event I am marketing on Oct 24 and haven’t been able to market because I can’t follow up with my customers since last friday. Different agents gave me different credentials to direct my email from my domain at the registrar. None of them told me that I need to add MX records too. I finally added that last night. It’s still not working!++++++++++++++
This is the absolute worst company in the world. I have been working on my website for weeks and then all of a sudden I couldn’t access wordpress. If you want to work on your website for how many hours only to lose everything, sign up with Bluehost!++++++++++++++
Support takes a very long time to answer and don’t know how to solve simple issues, hosting is slow and unstable.++++++++++++++
Bluehost has been a bad experience! We started using Bluehost about 5 years ago to host a few of our company websites. Things were fine. Then we added more websites, as well as our company email. In the last few months, we noticed our websites would go blank during the day. No explanation from Bluehost as to why it was happening – you would think they might contact us and inform us of the problem, and offer some solutions. We had to contact them – their suggestion was to move to a dedicated host because our website traffic was too large for a shared server. So we migrated. Apparently Bluehost does zero backups, and we lost a lot of valuable emails in the process. They also removed our SSL certificate, and told us it would cost $149/yr per site to get it back (we host about 20 sites). It also altered our ability to upload media files to our websites via wordpress, adversely limiting our ability to do work on our websites. Their answer is to use FTP – however, when you have 10 people who work on your websites and are familiar with WordPress, there is a learning curve to FTP.++++++++++++++
Bluehost may have all the bells and whistles, but no one is telling the truth that Bluehost loses your website contents which makes it not worth it. Their support which use to be helpful is no longer worth it. When you call the support agents, they mixed up the site content and add different databases, messing up website even more.++++++++++++++
I’ve been having cpanel access issues, login issues, payment issues for over a week. My site was taken down, and I was unable to pay BlueHost to get it back up. FInally got it back up and now I can’t access basic features such as File Manager. When I click File Manager in cpanel, I get logged out.++++++++++++++
I’m with bluehost for more than a year now.++++++++++++++

Never had a problem with them , online chat and customer support are always perfect .++++++++++++++

Cpanel is simple and it contains everything you need++++++++++++++

Simply Bluehost is the best++++++++++++++
I signed up with Bluehost last week and 4 days of it I couldn’t access my account. So frustrating trying to get it resolved and they definitely don’t want to honor the money back guarantee. I’m new to the blogging world and I definitely wouldn’t recommend them and sorry I clicked that link on one of my favorite sites. Im researching extensively before signing up with another company.++++++++++++++
After getting my site almost to the point it was ready to launch, they suddenly decided to deactivate it, because of ‘suspicious activity’. Their support could not tell me what this activity was, and i had to send all kinds of personal documents before they would reactivate me. Then some days later, out of the blue, they send me an email they refunded the whole service to me, deleting my account altogether. They did not mention the reason for this, and they gave no prior warning. And my data is gone. What use is their ‘site backup’ service if they just cancel your account without notice? I guess that’s why they are called *blue*host++++++++++++++
I am relatively new to Bluehost/Mojo. My experiences have been mostly poor over the past 6 months. Don’t believe much of the information that you are sold – to truly be able to create there are many more costs and much more time involved. Customer service at Bluehost has been nice, but generally unhelpful. Mojo marketplace is about upselling. When I called for help they suggested that I should have not shopped on my own, but called for their advice, so they could explain the complexity and intricacies as that information is not clear when making an online purchase.++++++++++++++
I filed a complaint in the past about Bluehost charging me for services that they were not providing to me, They would continually tell me the problem was being worked on but they had no clue when it would actually be fixed. For months they charged me and never provided the service, but would not give me a refund when I requested it. Finally I filed a complaint with the BBB. I quickly received a response from someone at Bluehost letting me know they’d fixed my website (interesting how they couldn’t fix the problem during all those months of my complaining but they immediately fixed the problem when I filed a complaint). They also offered me free months of service to make up for the time I’d lost. Sounds great right? WRONG! I dropped my complaint and accepted their offer because it was to much of a hassle at the time to leave Bluehost. As I said, they offered me free months of service to make up for the time I’d pay for but couldn’t manage my site. The problem is I STILL CAN’T MANAGE MY SITE! If it’s not one problem its another. My websites haven’t run smoothly for more than about a week at a time! So basically THEY STILL HAVEN’T COMPENSATED ME FOR THE SERVICES THEY CHARGED ME FOR BUT NEVER PROVIDED BECAUSE THEY STILL ARE NOT PROVIDING THE SERVICES. And their customer service is horrendous. EVERYTIME I open chat it ends with me wanting to scream the F-bomb and throw my computer across the room. Hate is a strong word, but I HATE bluehost. I would recommend anyone considering using them to LOOK ELSEWHERE for website hosting. save yourself the heading. Your money would be more put to better use being used as toilet tissue in a public urinal. I’m in the middle of working on my dissertation and finishing graduate school so I don’t have the time devote the attention needed to finding a new hosting site, but when I finish school in about a month I have ever intention of re-filing my complaint and leaving bluehost. STAY AWAY, for the sake of your own sanity.++++++++++++++
I had their pro plan, expecting adequate hosting speed and less hassle. I wasted countless hours trying to figure out why the subdomain isn’t propagating after I edited A record. After waiting around 30 minutes, I got connected to support staff. The support staff was extremely unresponsive and slow.++++++++++++++
Technical support appear to be good initially. But you will soon realize fixing small issues such as removing sitelock from my add-on to solve the SSL issue is a pain in the ass. First, ticket was created and promised that I will get response in 48 hrs. No response after 48 hrs. I followed up. Technical support promised they are working on the issue. After a few days, they are still saying the same thing. This makes me realize that the technical support doesn’t know what’s going on. Who is really working and whether there is anyone working on the ticket. Worst – I am on Biz Pro plan and I have no direct access to the server terminal to fix the problem myself – which might be even faster than their technical support. Extremely disappointed.++++++++++++++
Just left bluehost, and thank god I finally did. Wanna talk about price jumps ? I went from paying a little under 100 a year roughly to 200z my site was down endless amounts of times. A customer service lacks. Anytime I’ve called, it takes easily an hour to get ahold of anyone. And I recently called about my renewal, and the customer service agent snapped at me. I was completely baffled that I was treated that way by someone who is taking my money. I’m now with SiteGround. They switched everything over for me, for free. They even called me to welcome me ! Really needed hay after my horrific phone convo with bluehost. So glad I switched. Unless you love shit customer service, and your site consistently down, don’t go with bluehost !++++++++++++++
So I have this php uptime script to tell me what the server load is. It auto refreshes every 30 seconds. keeps a temporary list of server performance and refreshes every 30 seconds.++++++++++++++
I was unexpectedly shut down with no warning. I have no idea why. Three days trying to get help. Three days. Today I am sitting at my computer reading all the bad reviews of this company. I paid them my money ahead, in good faith, and they have no concern that my website that helps thousands of people a day is off line. I can only assume they plan to not ever put it back online as no one will talk to me. So, they will keep my money I pay them and never explain to me why they shut my website down. I only have limited knowledge and what I do have is self-taught, so what ever happened to cause my website to be shut down did not come from me, because I wouldn’t know what to do. Please don’t get yourself in this predicament. I will find another host and lose days trying to get everything back up and running, while BlueHost continues to reach their customers like nuisances. BlueHost should be ashamed that they are not only treating their customers like this but the thousands, upon thousands of people with missing people that depend on my site to share their missing information.++++++++++++++
Web hosting is crucial for your WordPress site. The performance of your site mainly depends on your web hosting service. There are different web hosting providers. Bluehost is one of the leading. But I think it should not be your best choice.++++++++++++++

I am not happy with their customer support, it is not a cheap web hosting service.++++++++++++++

Their tech support is not perfect for the users especially the beginners. Because they have many problems.++++++++++++++

Bluehost performance is average. They have many things should be improved.++++++++++++++
They somehow deleted all my files. Waited 20 minutes to talk to customer service. No apologies. No explanation. No help. I have been a client for almost 10 years.++++++++++++++
AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! Refused to refund my money!!++++++++++++++
Every hosting has it’s own pros and cons. If you ask me whether bluehost is the best hosting then I would say No.++++++++++++++
Just one thing to say… HORRIBLE. for small sites works fine once you have traffic you will notice the issues and support is extremely slow and their replies horrible too. Been with them for years but finally moving, just cant take it anymore++++++++++++++
Bluehost is the best hosting provider,using it for last 2 years and no problems there.++++++++++++++
I am very disappointed with Bluehost. At first, I thought it is good since a lot of big blogs recommended them. But I think they only care on what they can get on the affiliate commission.++++++++++++++
Numerous changes to website files by Bluehost has lead to my site being hacked, and deactivated among other things. Never had an issue with the site until Bluehost made changes to my htaccess file and core files. Since then its been issue after issue. As soon as I can I will be transferring the site to another hosting site!++++++++++++++
Horrible customer service! Have absolutely no knowledge about what they are doing. Took me 3 days to purchase SSL certificate, in the end they installed wrong SSL. Every customer service representative told me something different. Literally feels like talking to my 80 year old grandma about internet.++++++++++++++
I Am to the edge of losing my job now due to the worst desision of my life: moving to Bluehost! It was so a terrible mistake, it has been a nightmare since the beginning. I can firmly tell you after talking to one after one after one support agent thay they don’t have the slightest idea of what they are talking about, support agents can barely speak good english (worst than mine), they talk like they are on India or somewhere there, and they are not prepare for REAL TROUBLE, they are just prepared to dumb solutions like: restart your computer, use another browser, it is your ISP problem, for God’s sake! This is a nightmare.++++++++++++++
My wife and I chose Blue Host because of good reviews that we now believe were paid contractors for the purpose of making Blue Host look really good. We bought the extra help for WordPresslive. Our hold times have ranged from 30 minutes to over an hour. At times we actually held for over 40 minutes and when someone did answer they simply hung up. When I demanded to speak with a supervisor I was put off saying he was not available. I kept insisting until Zack ( wouldn’t give last name) answered. He promised that a customer service person would now help me. The help lasted 20 minutes, the wait lasted over and hour. We are going to try and get our money back and switch to something else.++++++++++++++
I signed up for an account last week and had trouble installing Drupal 8. I contacted support (Chat only) and they installed it with a temp IP address for me. I clicked on a link in Drupal and it resolved to some strange URL. They said I had SSL installed, I said I do not need SSL. They made some changes and said it would take a couple hours to work.++++++++++++++

A day later it still does not work. I’ve have been on support chat for a couple hours now.++++++++++++++

Today I take two hours to find out that it will not work with a temp IP and I need a domain name to point to it.++++++++++++++

All I get from them is sorry!!!++++++++++++++
I installed Jetpack on my site from day one (10/10/2015). I have had around 10,000 emails in my inbox from Jetpack telling me your site is offline, your site is back up, your site is offline, your site is back up, etc. etc. etc. etc. Then there is the speed, so sloooooowwwww! Absolutely attrocious, if you value your website and your sanity DO NOT USE!!!++++++++++++++
Guys you should be very careful with them (bluehost.com).++++++++++++++

At the beginning i was very glad to work with them.++++++++++++++

I host several hobby projects into their hosting. These sites have not significant visitors around 50 per day for all of my sites.++++++++++++++

The good Part:++++++++++++++

I should be honest bluehost have no major down time for the whole period i used them 3 years.++++++++++++++
Bluehost support is very helpful once you actually get a support representative to answer the call. The customer support prompts (when you call) are not very clear. The routing choices for support calls is spotty at best. It doesn’t repeat prompts so you aren’t sure what number to select; I’m betting customers hang up and dial again do to poor call routing info. Once you’ve selected the Bluehost support option, the wait time is longer than 5 minutes for sure. 5 minutes would be on a good day.++++++++++++++
Stay away. I have been a client for many years and regret it daily.++++++++++++++

Renewal prices are not posted (there is a link at the bottom of the page). Super low signup price, then high renewal fees.++++++++++++++

Servers crash at least once a year for a day or more at a time. No explanation, no apologies.++++++++++++++

My account is ‘deactivated’ at least once a year for various reasons. Too many files, Malware, etc.++++++++++++++

Deactivated WITHOUT warning!++++++++++++++
I’m using WordPress hosting account on Bluehost from last 2 year but still, i’ve not found any problem with this hosting company, their customer services is very good and prices are also better than other hosting company so I suggest this hosting company all of you,++++++++++++++
Well, I switched to BlueHost to increase the page load speed, etc. That’s not happening! In fact, it’s really bad with going into wp-admin. The recent outage too me by surprise and in talking with them I asked about “cloud redundancy” and was told the entire cloud service was down. There is something definitely wrong with that picture and they really need to look at how they are configured. Anyway, the pricing hook is dead on and I was believed to think I’d get the intro price for 12 months but guess what? Not gonna happen unless you do 3 years. I talked, at length with sales before making the switch and wasn’t told that, in fact was told just the opposite. So, yeah I felt the bait/switch routine.++++++++++++++
Worst hosting provider. My sire down for 4 time in a year and now experienced the worst -11 hours and still down. They can’t give a solution and my site is still down, cause a big lost. Don’t use them, don’t be like me. Losing business every minutes. I hate them!++++++++++++++
I have used bluehost for about 8 months, having transferred from Pressable. I regretted changing almost straight away. The customer service is worse than terrible. Live chat seems to be run by people that have near 0 relevant knowledge. Everything is painful. Oh, and the server response time was really really slow++++++++++++++
U had an electric blue reseller account which allowed me to create and admin cp for each customer and dedicated ip website, for each wevsite i sold++++++++++++++

After about 2 years Bluehost decided to stop doing reseller accounts, downgraded my account without warning, kept charging me for the full reseller account with all features (now all featurtes removed)..++++++++++++++

Now i cannot get to the control admin panels of each domain i installed and sold, because Bluehost removed them, deleting them from server++++++++++++++
I would like to start by saying that BlueHost is a pretty great Web Hosting Service. I have used it for Hosting WordPress Websites and I can see it is having great speed, good functionalities and OK Support. Another great thing that really made me go for is their Affordable Prices. I find the prices just right.++++++++++++++

Happy with BlueHost. I had few minor issues but that wasn’t big of a deal. I still continue to use BlueHost and I would recommend it for fellow bloggers and Web designers.++++++++++++++

There are rarely any downtimes. I never faced any huge downtimes with bluehost.++++++++++++++

If you are looking for a good Web Hosting with great Speed, Security and Reliability for an Affordable Price, Blue Host is one of them.++++++++++++++
I have been with Bluehost for up to 5 years but I am totally fed up. For the first time in a long while I finally got 3 sites that were getting traffic! What did Bluehost do? The throttled the sites and now it takes over 10 minutes to load a page.++++++++++++++
Most of the factors they’ve mentioned is right but seems biased to getting boom to a different brand and neglecting competitor. Reason:++++++++++++++
Terrible customer service just trying to renew a domain name that someone had registered 5 years ago. The person that registered the account no longer worked for the airport.++++++++++++++
They have the WORST customer service. When Comcast fires their employees they go work for Bluehost. Be prepared to WAIT…and wait….and wait for a response. I told them my email wasn’t working, 10 minutes later they told me it was because my password had expired (news to me) and that I needed to reset it. Went to log in and suddenly my password no longer works. 7 minutes later they tell me I have to reset it and they will email me a link. I reminded them my email did not work 11 minutes later they told me I needed to log in and change my primary email address to a different one, I reminded them again I was not able to log in so they told me I needed to figure out how to log in so I could reset ALL my passwords. Not helpful at all.++++++++++++++
Bluehost was down for 2 weeks, then 3 weeks within 2016 alone and on subsequent months, not to mention the single day blackouts. Their real uptime for 2016 at around 92%, lowest in the industry. (measured by a customer, who have more than 10 sites with them)++++++++++++++
I’ve been using BlueHost for over 5 years and as soon as I can, I’m going to leave them. Why? When one of their support agents activated an spam email filter feature, they brought down all email accounts for my domain. All external emails to any address on the domain now bounceback. I have called 4 times now lasting 30 to 50 minutes each time. When I call during the day, they promise it will be resolved by the close of business. When I call around the close of business they said by the next day. It’s an endless cycle spanning 3 days now without email. They are either incompetent or really just don’t care about service. If you don’t mind multiple days of downtime for a problem they caused, by all means, use Bluehost.++++++++++++++
I have been with Bluehost for at least a dozen years and its uptime and reliability have been acceptable. Then, last year I lost out on a major opportunity when the Bluehost mail server failed to deliver a message from a client I have worked for in the past. I later found out from the client’s website that I was shortlisted but failed to submit the requested tender documents by the deadline. I should have changed hosts back then, but I didn’t have time to do the migration. Last week I naively renewed for three years and upgraded to Bluehost cloud hosting.++++++++++++++
I have several website with BH and they do load slow and when I call and finally get thru they blame everything but themselves. Then suddenly the sites work ok again, just ok.++++++++++++++

BIGGEST issue however is that their email does not work well with Apple products. I have lost countless hours fixing and sometimes giving up trying to get their email to work on iphones and mac. I am leaving due to this issue.++++++++++++++

I would not use BH!!!++++++++++++++
Terrible hosting service. Always going down due to servers being open to attack. Tech support unable to fix issues. Unable to get emails due to attacks on server. Told it will be fixed as soon as possible with no time frame. After a week of no emails and no idea when my website would be fully functional I had to relocate my website to a new host. I moved to GoDaddy, so far they have been very reliable, affordable and the tech support great.++++++++++++++
I have been very happy with Bluehost.com. Their technical support had helped me through humps. Can’t ask for anything more at $3.49 per month for a 3-year into price with multiple websites.++++++++++++++
I am using Bluehost from 2014 and my experience with Bluehost is just excellent, I never encountered a single hosting problem in last 3 yeas, The customer support provided by them is even awesome. I 100% Recommend Bluehost to everyone.++++++++++++++
I have been with BlueHost for a 2+ years now. I have a WordPress and a PHP site hosted with them. I agree that performance isn’t great (as the numbers show) but luckily my sites are small and don’t get much traffic so I don’t think it affects me much. If any of my sites get popular or start making me money, I would probably switch over to something else. But for now, the price is great – I locked in my rate for 3 years so I wouldn’t have to worry about the price going up.++++++++++++++
I tried signing up with Bluehost but I had an awful time with their customer service. It took an hour for a representative to answer my initial inquiry and once she did, she wasn’t understanding what I was saying and she wasn’t able to help. I decided that if this is the way they treat new customers who are trying to sign up, this is not a company I want to use. Thank you for this post… I found some other great options that I’m going to try!++++++++++++++
I recently created a server-based solution for my client and he unfortunately was using Blue Host’s services. The first time I tried to access, their whole setup was down due to “maintenance” and it stayed like that for several hours. I gave up and tried next day again. I was able to login but wasn’t able to access databases because they were experiences “technical issues”. Tried to contact their technical support and got this message “We are experiencing an exceptional amount of traffic, we apologize”. Worst experience with any hosting company so far!++++++++++++++
I’m currently waiting for Bluehost to get their act together and get our site (along with multiple other sites) back online. Until about an hour ago their own site had an “under maintenance” image on the home page. But now Bluehost.com is back online as usual, while my ecommerce site is still down after 10 hours of waiting on a weekend before Christmas with no estimated time for it to be fixed. For the amount we’re paying I really want to find a more reliable host!++++++++++++++
I just wanted to try blogging, but at 61 years old it is a bit too complicated for me. BlueHost is dragging me through the mud since I did not cancel within 30 days. I only used this website for 4 hours total.++++++++++++++
I’ve been with bluehost 10-15 years, and used to be quite happy with their hosting, prices, and I understood the limitations of shared hosting, but for the most part it didn’t matter for my purposes. I now have a few packages personally, shared, VPS, Cloud, and manage about 50ish of my clients that use bluehost as well. The last 6 months service-wise has been appalling. Slow, lies, misinformation, and it honestly feels like they’ll tell you anything to get you to just go away; try to get them to listen to logic, forget it! I am now recommending all of my clients on bluehost leave, because when they have issues I don’t want to be the one they call to deal with BlueHost’s support. I also agree, their server responses have gotten extremely laggy, and oddly enough the shared hosting seems faster than packages that are supposed to be much better.++++++++++++++
I provide a number of services to home users for personal and super small business use.++++++++++++++
I have used bluehost since college, and I LOVED it. the last few times I have gone in for sales or tech support, it’s just been 3rd party chat help. NASTY when you need tech help especially! in the past, bluehost had their own tech support and it was awesome!!! Now half the time they don’t even understand my question and just tell me to buy this or that, it also took an average 10 minutes in between each question to even get a response!!++++++++++++++
I’m absolutely shocked at the POOR level of service Blue Host provides. It seems they have outsourced their customer service to providers whose representatives barely even understand English and are incapable of answering questions clearly and to the point. Not to mention, the company doesn’t even bother to answer complaints about the poor level of services. DISGRASEFUL & DISRESPECTFUL TO CUSTOMERS. All I can recommend is that you stay clear of Blue Host – there are far better hosing companies out there.++++++++++++++
I have had a site with Bluehost, mostly problem free for the past five years. Previous issues have been resolved efficiently, but not anymore!++++++++++++++
I just moved to what they called cloud private hosting as I had too many files and problems started. First they screwed up DNS configuration and FTP, then migration caused 8 hour downtime. Every other day there is timeout gateway error on my websites, technical support is arogant. Moving out of them.++++++++++++++
I’ve been with Bluehost for almost a year, I have a VPS with them, the uptime for the last 12 months is 100%, support is beyond good, they reply to me quickly usually within 5 minutes, last Friday morning, I was playing with Apache setting, trying to optimize Apache through WHM and finally I got a 403 forbidden error , my website went down, I couldn’t fix it…so I connected live chat support, they responded in less than 60 seconds, after 5 min. live chat support couldn’t fix the issue, he said to me: ” please wait for 5-10 min, I’ll get you a senior technician to fix your problem” 7 or 8 minutes later, he said to me : you site back to work , the senior technician said there was a problem with WHM and he gets it fixed” it took 17 -18 min. to fix my issue….++++++++++++++
You can pretty much judge / rate / review ANY company–in ANY industry–by their level of customer support. And from the perspective, Bluehost should be rated a 1 out of 10. If you are an existing Bluehost customer, there is literally no way to contact them directly. They have an 888# and a chat feature only… both of which are outsourced to India and take a LONG time to get through to anyone… and usually results in zero actual assistance or results.++++++++++++++
I used Bluehost for a few years. Always thought their customer support was bad (previous migration crashed 300 images on my WP site), but price was OK so I didn’t care. A few years went by before I had any uptime issue with them.++++++++++++++
So I decided that I wanted to start a blog. Just do a bit of writing in my spare time.++++++++++++++
On hold for Bluehost to answer phone on a Sunday morning with “estimated wait time is 38 minutes”(somehow this was increased from my initial 31 minutes) Should I hang up now?. I noticed Bluehost answer phone very quickly if you call for their “sales” department and for the most part, each salesman I’ve talked to is very nice and also the tech department people.++++++++++++++
IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR DOMAIN OR EMAIL DO NOT USE BLUEHOST!!!!++++++++++++++
Some issues you mentioned perhaps are true, but it’s just to make BlueHost black.++++++++++++++
I was sucked into the low price offer and the recommendation from WordPress.org, I did have good service for 3 years. I then noticed my Jetpack plugin show a lot of down time moments through out 3 year period. Also it is quite slow, and speed is important for ranking with google. But what stopped my trust was the renewal fee of $11 a month, that is more than 100% increase in price. I think someone managing Blue Host decided that since customers are on auto renewal, lets just double the price and we will be instantly rich.++++++++++++++
I don’t know what their problem is. Most recently on Saturday September 24, 2016 at 11 PM we received SiteLock message. I contacted the terms of service department and Rick told me he would have to run a scan on our domains. I told him we were up to date on all extensions, etc. I sat on hold for a total of 45 minutes and Rick said he had no choice but to lock our sites down due to malware being found on our sites. He gave me a list of the files and I immediately tried to determine why and worked all night and found no problems with the files.++++++++++++++
I have never seen before like Blue Host bad service, bad contact and a lot of mistake by Blue Host!++++++++++++++
Bluehost hosting is terribly slow and when contacted them they claim it is because it’s shared ip and it is shared with over 2000 other websites (each IP) and their chat support is a big JOKE takes 1 hour sometimes.++++++++++++++

They tried to sell me another package, obviously more expensive but I am not giving them no business anymore.++++++++++++++
Bluehost is the worst webhosting I have ever come across. They will just deactivate your account without notification or warning. Their server goes down way more than you expect. You may not even know they have deactivated your account or you website is no more working until you try to login. If you sell a lot per day, you will lose a lot of money. If you are unlucky, Google will just derank you from the first page and you lose all you traffics.++++++++++++++
Ive been with Bluehost for almost 10 years. I used to love them. I would call and wait times were no more than 2 or 5 mins. Now, its 45 to 60 min. And they keep auto-blocking my businesses static IP because they assume we are hacking or something stupid. We are growing, we have a larger database, more inventory data and photos going online. I’ve explained this to them 5 times, and this is the 6th time they have taken my site down, my employees can’t get emails. and i am on hold, it says 31 minutes, but experience tells me that its probably going to be an hour before we can start selling and operating again.++++++++++++++
BlueHost’s support is one of the worst ever!++++++++++++++

I’m using webhosting services for more than 10 years and never had such a bad service in my life ?++++++++++++++

Response time is more than 24 hours. Chat is not working most of the time.++++++++++++++

Their tutorials are lacking and to cancel the subscription is a nightmare.++++++++++++++
I JUST switched to today so don’t consider this to be a full review, but I do have some observations worth noting.++++++++++++++
Bluehost is a money-worth as I am using it for two years and have to faced nay big issue, other than slight downtime’s which can come with any web host, but most of the times, my website was up and running within few minutes.++++++++++++++
I cant’n enter in my acconunt suddenly recived a 500 erro and a long serie ob digits.++++++++++++++
Besides the terrible support Bluehost increases the renewal price with 32.78% without notification for the second year!++++++++++++++
They used to be OK apart from slow loading on some websites. Now if you need tech support there is no ticket system and a wait of usually 30-40 minutes to speak with someone. Really wordpress.org should not endorse them++++++++++++++
Auto-Renewal won’t refund despite never having used the service and hosted elsewhere for almost two years. Service rep actually laughed at me on the call.++++++++++++++
I’ve had Bluehost for just 2 months and I’ve literally contacted tech support more than one per week.++++++++++++++
Used to be a good hosting company. Downhill for a year now, with problems escalating since Jan 2016. Cpanel does not work. Hotlink protection does not work. Contacted support and they tried to blame me. I told them it was a file change they had made and I had deleted my htaccess file and used their own cpanel hotlink protection and it failed. Support person deleted files they had changed to erase their fingerprint and it still does not work. Domain manager, cannot disable Privacy Protection. Chat support unable to assist said created Help ticket. Copy sent does not include issue. Contacted support again to verify ticket and was told nothing they can do, Domain Support not in on weekends! So much for the 24/7 support they advertise! Make Copies of EVERY contact with Bluehost including your billing info. This is interstate commerce and carried out over wire.++++++++++++++
I signed up in 2007 and things were fine. Quick & helpful tech support access, easy cPanel navigation, no problems. That is not the case now.++++++++++++++
It doesn’t matter if you pay for the cheapest or the most expensive plan: all of them suck.++++++++++++++

When you finally get to contact Technical support, it’s a a Sales agent in disguise. They will tell you to upgrade to a better plan in order to solve all the problems.++++++++++++++

After upgrading nothing will change, except that your site was down for 72 hours (at first they say migrations take 2 hours and your site will be live, that’s a lie).++++++++++++++

If you got to the point to contact support because your site doesn’t work, I strongly recommend you start looking for another company.++++++++++++++
After reading numerous glowing reviews, I opted to move my domain from GoDaddy to to Blue Host and build a new web site. Serious mistake. In setting up an account and moving my domain, I had a couple of simple questions before I proceeded. I called Blue Host, opened a chat window, called a second time, and NEVER got through to anyone. I was told they were experiencing a very high call volume. I tried again the next day. No luck. The third day I finally got in touch with a live person! I was so angry at the amount of my time they wasted, I just asked for a cancellation of my account and a refund. I was told that would be done, but it was not. I called again this morning and was once again put on hold for 17 minutes because they were “experiencing a high call volume”. I opened a chat screen, but could not get any help. Finally, I got a guy on the phone who refused to allow me to speak with a supervisor. He said he would process a refund and cancellation. In all, I have wanted approximately 3.25 hours over four days attempting to answer a couple of questions and resolve two minor issues. I got my questions answered after about an hour and a half, and my ‘issues’ were never resolved by technical assistance. Once they get your money, they just kind of give you the finger.++++++++++++++
I have used bluehost for probably about three years now, and although I have never been particularly happy with them I foolishly continued to give them my money. Today however was the last straw,++++++++++++++

and at this point in I would go as far as saying I believe they are the worst company I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with. There sales people outright lied to me to get me to upgrade to a faster server. I explained I had a launch and needed the site to be working for the launch date . He told me no problem it would take 1 – 2 hours for the migration. After 4 hours I decided to contact customer service. It was at this point that 1 – 2 hours turned into 4 – 8, then 8 -12. Now here I am on launch day with no site and 8 – 12 hours has turned into up to 72 hours, and what does customer service have to say? Sorry there is nothing we can do about it, it will take as long as it takes. Needless to say I will be switching to another hosting provider ASAP. IF YOU’RE CONSIDERING BLUEHOST AS AN OPTION I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU STEER CLEAR OF THEM AND ANYTHING THAT EVEN LOOKS LIKE THEM.++++++++++++++
You almost went a year without effing up too badly, Bluehost. Aside from being really slow, you were fine.++++++++++++++
I am using Bluehost for last 5 years to manage around 30 websites.++++++++++++++

Here is my exact feedback.++++++++++++++

1. Email service is bad. Very slow. Poor interface. Most of my customers complained about email slowness, so we were forced to switch email hosting to Rediff/Google.++++++++++++++

2. Support is good. Everytime support is available on chat or call. They are supportive and many times they helped me to fix the issue except few times depends on the chat person.++++++++++++++

3. Worst thing is, if they found any website malware issue, they will simply deactivate the service and all of my customers started to complain.++++++++++++++

4. Hosting multiple websites on server facitlity is good. Cpanel features are good. WordPress installation is also good.++++++++++++++

5. Cost is too affordable.++++++++++++++
This company is horrible. They were an improvement form godaddy but their reliability and support is subpar. I questioned a renewal bill and was told to “feel free to look elsewhere”. My advise, look elsewhere!++++++++++++++
At the beginning of 2016 we switched from Pagely.com to Bluehost on request by a supplier we used. What a mistake! Page load times have doubled and the site goes down. The worst part is that their support is slow and almost non-existing. They dropped ticket support so you have to wait for a long time for agents to respond by phone or chat. When they respond they don’t have to competence to resolve the problem. One problem has been attempted four times – this is two hours of painfully slow chat dialogue with them. Now I want to shift but unfortunately they have me tied down with upfront payment – and I can’t find the time to get it back…++++++++++++++
I just switched from Bluehost to A2 Hosting. Getting my files back from Bluehost was like having a quadruple root canal. It took about 4 days & 7 or 8 phone calls, not counting the times I hung up after waiting 15+ minutes.++++++++++++++
They aspire to be the cable company. Big, dumb and slow. Worst of ALL time. Change away from tickets means no one is accountable. Front line support is terrible. Wait and chat hold times are terrible. Chat to India is useless. No escalation protocols, so you will never speak to a person who knows ‘enough’ and your issue will never be escalated to anyone who can fix it.++++++++++++++
Bad service, with really terrible customer service. I was not pleased with the support I was receiving and then they made me go through several uncessesssry steps to finally cancel my account. Poor ethics which is really unacceptable.++++++++++++++
These guys are the worst, I’ve had nothing but issues with them from the start. Customer service is horrible, I asked them to change a cpanel password and instead they reset our wordpress website then said “Sorry we can’t pull the backup because it’s corrupt” Are you kidding me????? Now I’m having issues with server emails being blacklisted and they are telling me it’s MY FAULT and I need to go to each email client and ask to be removed. I haven’t changed a single thing. STAY FAR FAR AWAY.++++++++++++++
I have around 20 sites hosted with Bluehost under several different accounts, including my own company’s site on a VPS plan. The live chat is extremely slow, the reps don’t bother to read your initial post (I include the last 4 validation to try and speed up getting to the root question, so what is the first thing I am asked for? “Please validate your account.”), and their product knowledge at times is poor, to say the least. Phone support is usually a lot faster, plus you’re apt to get someone more technically adept.++++++++++++++
I joined Blue Host because there online chat customer service was quick and easy and i thought i would get some good help.++++++++++++++

Not even 1 week into building my web site I had had 3 500 server errors and each time was unable to change my password I was helped out using their live chat but the 4th time they recommended changing my e-mail address I didn’t understand why I should have to but finally agreed.++++++++++++++
This is the worst web hosting company you can ever land with. Their live chat is worthless and manned by staff with zero knowledge and no access to systems that can help you resolve your issue.++++++++++++++
I really wish I would have seen this review before opting to go with Bluehost. My other option was Ipage and with all the reviews out there I figured Bluehost was the best option. I still haven’t been able to get on to design my site. It keeps saying 20% install of WordPress. It’s been all morning so far.++++++++++++++
I have been fighting with Blue Host for the last 2 years! You are right, waiting over an hour EACH time is horrendous. In one week, I contacted them 3 times, each wait time was more than 5 minutes. When I finally got through, they were not responsive and didn’t fix the issue. Instead they tried to upsell me when their services I already paid for doesn’t even work. Christmas of both 2014 & 2015 my site was down for an entire week. They refuse to reimburse my downtime. My site is all about shopping, especially for holidays etc. They have cost me clients and money. I’ve also tried contacting them so I can move everything to my new host and they have been refusing for 8 months now. So they are also holding my info hostage? Today 7/29 I am up for renewal and it doesn’t even let me log in to renew. I’m now taking it to the BBB and anything else I will be going full public, I have screen shots, logs and all to prove they steal peoples money and do not offer refunds at all. Anyone who is earning commission/affiliate from them I will never respect, never buy from and never recommend to anyone. The photo I showed is from 3/12/16 and that is just 1 proof I have. I’ve never got anything past 50% uptime and 14% uptime was typical. Because of the constant downtime, each of those sites barely got 50 visitors per month! With my new host, within 1 week of switching I get well over 2K visits per month and have 0% downtime.++++++++++++++
So we have built and sold 100s of websites. Most hosted on Bluehost. Recently we started building a site that will have much more traffic than the other small business sites that we usually create.++++++++++++++

During construction (before any traffic) the site goes down weekly (often daily). The pages load very slowly or we get page/server errors.++++++++++++++

Past clients are now filling our email boxes with questions why their sites are always down. Why they can not get email. Sure it may only be for an hour but when this happens weekly or many times a week it makes us look bad and people lose buisness.++++++++++++++

Seems Bluehost has out grown its capabilities. We will be looking for a better host solution.++++++++++++++

It is ashamed they have become the worst option now instead of the best option like we sold them to clients as being.++++++++++++++

Keep your affiliate money Bluehost and make your servers reliable.++++++++++++++

Thanks for the information on this page.++++++++++++++
Their hosting has been getting workse and worse. My website has been down. And now e-mail server problems. It’s become a big headache. Will be switching as soon as I have time to deal with it…++++++++++++++
Please don’t go for this hosting because it will turn into your worst nightmare. At least once a week your site will be down. Now they closed the possibillty of open a technical support ticket. A technical support must go through their bad and outsourced chat service somewhere in India. Run away from Bluehost!!++++++++++++++
After having Bluehost for years, they slowly added more and more cost to my yearly hosting. In the end, it was costing my around $300 for basic capped bandwidth and space. Just after I renewed for yet another year, I started getting harassing phone calls from some Security Service that Bluehost apparently uses. Sitelock. They are telling me mysteriously now, my website has some virus and I need to pay $500 to have them get rid of it or Bluehost is going to cancel my account.++++++++++++++
I have been a customer with BH for the past 9 years, and the past 3 months it has been BAD I mean really BAD, support have no idea on what they are doing, Billing you get no response after ticket after ticket, chatting with support, at the end I was blocked out of my account and still it was not solved. A simple renewal of an account, how simple that that be.++++++++++++++

Before you do decide to use BH make sure you have all the correct information before starting, They are betting to big and cannot handle the load I think.++++++++++++++

I support Mikey on his findings …++++++++++++++
My website is DealMirror.com. This company can’t change my DNS server and my email also not working. I am shocked what a cheap company. We do not have your nameservers, https://www.whatsmydns.net/#NS/DealMirror.com That means we can’t update your DNS server.++++++++++++++

Don’t purchase this cheap hosting .++++++++++++++
I managed a website on a wordpress platform for a medium size business for 4 years. Their hosting service started out well for us but after about 18 months the site speed started to decline so I upgraded to a VPS business package which only helped for a few months.++++++++++++++

As time went on I experienced declining results in page load speed, a marked increase in traffic throttling (a real bummer when multiple clients are trying to browse your site), and more frequent down times.++++++++++++++

In the beginning I was very happy with Bluehost. Having that first year happy experience set me up for disappointment later as the site grew along with hosting expenses.++++++++++++++

I will say that Bluehost support on the phone was great the first year and their resource library will walk any newbie through just about every question asked in simple clear video tutorials. For a small noncritical site I think they are a fine host, but for a business wishing to be successful I don’t recommend them after your site traffic grows.++++++++++++++
I have had nothing but trouble with bluehost. I manage a number of sites, including our company website, and their support was unhelpful at best. My almost brand new (ie, not bogged down) WP installation was dealing with 10-15 second load times, if it would load at all. It was a combination of DB and filesystem issues. And another site was taken offline for almost 3 days due to bluehost’s database issues, and as I was transferring a third away from them, the whole server itself crashed, leaving me without my site’s data for the rest of the day, and the site offline. Their hosting on some of their boxes is simply unreliable, and their databases are even worse.++++++++++++++
This is the most unethical company that exists today. They will shut down your site and domain if you do not want to renew with them. They will ask you to hold for customer support and NEVER answer – called many many times and always the same thing. The HELP CHAT is USELESS because as soon as you mention to them you’re not going to renew with them, they just close the chat on you. WORST COMPANY !!! DO NOT GO WITH BLUEST.com !!! DO NOT GO WITH BLUEHOST.COM ! They caused a lot of trouble for my business so do not make the same mistake!++++++++++++++
If your website gets to much traffic they will deactivate your account including all websites associated with it without notice.++++++++++++++
I’ve encountered many downtimes, recently it was one downtime per day for an average of 10 minutes. They are insolent enough not to get back to me after I succeeded at last to create a support ticket. The chat option is horrible. I’m going to leave them today. This is not a company that deserves giving service and I can’t rely on them when I give service to my website’s users.++++++++++++++
First off, their support is absolutely atrocious. It is an incredible waste of time when you are stuck in a “virtual cue” for 10-15 minutes and then the support person cuts off the live chat after 20 minutes of painful conversations. This happens time and again.++++++++++++++
We’ve been with Bluehost for many years. Recently we have encountered problems with e-mails sent from the site. When something goes wrong and there have been no software changes on our end, the finger points to a server issue. The most recent problem was html-formatted e-mails being sent from the code by the mature and widely used phpmailer library. They were being sent as plain text with nr paragraph codes embedded. A ticket to technical support was returned telling us that they don’t offer software support (which we never asked for) and to upgrade PHP from 5.3 to 5.4. This was the wrong answer, given that phpmailer works back to PHP 5.1.++++++++++++++
I’ve been using Bluehost many years.. I’m on a shared hosting plan with no traffic limit. The price is standard and in general – the performance is ‘OK’, however lately looks weak…++++++++++++++
Bluehost has been around for a long time and I have been a happy customer for a few years.++++++++++++++
I had been hosting with Bluehost for a few months. A client called me and said they were having trouble logging into their email. I logged into cpanel and they were correct, their email address was somehow missing. I quickly called bluehost, and they agreed that some hosting accounts were just dropping email accounts. All the emails were still on the server, but every once in a while I would need to recreate the account for the client to access it.++++++++++++++
I have been a Bluehost user for almost 5 years now. Bluehost has consistently provided outstanding tech support. I would absolutely recommend Bluehost to a friend.++++++++++++++
Definitely have to shout out for BlueHost. I have three domains registered, with two active websites. Registering the domains was a piece of cake as was setting up the first website. The second was originally a WordPress free site that I moved to BlueHost. The transition was seamless.++++++++++++++
As someone who has never built a website, I was hopeful that the easy-to-use advertisement of Bluehost would ring true. Unfortunately, once I began the process of building the website, it got complicated and getting help would cost me even more money!++++++++++++++
Overall, I’ve had a great experience with Bluehost, and I’ve been using them for about 4 years. I started with the Basic shared hosting package and later upgraded to the Business Pro plan.++++++++++++++
I paid for my servers. For the longest time I couldn’t use SFTP and they took a week to transfer registrars. That means I had almost a week of down time until I could get to AWS.++++++++++++++
I’ve been using Bluehost for several years – mostly for myself and some of my clients (I’m WordPress developer).++++++++++++++
I like these guys a lot better than my previous host 1&1. They have great tech support (most of the time), are polite and responsive (short wait times). I especially like the tools they provide: cPanel, WordPress Tools, SpamAssassin, etc. Highly recommended.++++++++++++++
The WordPress-specific hosting plan at BlueHost feels a bit pricey, and I don’t know if I’ll ever get over that feeling, but the setup and management steps I’ve taken with my new site have been noticeably faster than other WP sites I’ve run.++++++++++++++
: gets a site up ASAP. a simple site, like for a small business, will be fine with bluehost. their people actually will assist with WordPress related problems and issues, which 1&1 would not even touch.++++++++++++++
Keep in mind that Bluehost does not offer monthly payments, instead you’ll need pay upfront for a year or more. This is something that turned me off while going through their signing process…++++++++++++++
I manage several websites with Bluehost and have nothing but a good experience with them. Their cPanel is well laid out & easy to do most tasks like upload WordPress or setup email accounts. There are plenty of helpful tutorial videos & pages that get you going as well.++++++++++++++
I’ve had great experiences with Bluehost.++++++++++++++
BlueHost has consistently been a reliable hosting service since my first day as a digital entrepreneur. Their prices are affordable and the quality is on par. The customer service is quick and always able to resolve any questions or concerns that I have.++++++++++++++
Bluehost is hands down one of the best hosting platforms fo++++++++++++++
