I always, every time get a guy who speaks English, and understands my issue from the first time I explain it, they politely ask the questions to find my issue (even if I don\u2019t know what I am talking about lol), they stay on the phone with me until the issue is solved and they give excellent advice and recommendations on other things I might be interested in to make things work better. I also learn a lot from them!

In the beginning there were quite a few issues and they needed sorting out however now it is plain awesome. My server is almost never down, support is always available and since I am based in a different time zone the online chat support is super important. When you add to this the great CDN integration that makes sure to keep all the sites online it is simply outstanding.

The performance is awful. Our site hosted by them used to be offline for at least half an hour every week. They blocked out SMTP and now anything I need they make you pay extra for VPS. Just so they can make more money! 4 years ago they were so much better before they started offering the VPS and dedicated options. Sometimes people are more important than money. When you become greedy people will leave and they will have less money.

After being with several other hosting companies I have to say that BlueHost is one of the top hosting providers. Whenever I have a question or need help their technical support team is always available. They answer immediately and they speak proper English. It is very important to know that you are dealing with a company that provides excellent customer support. Since I have signed up with BlueHost everything has been working perfectly.

I pay about ten dollars a month now since I finished the first year on shared hosting. I don\u2019t think that the service justifies the price. The uptime and loading time is very inconsistent. It goes from 3-9 seconds at different times in the day. The technical support doesn\u2019t seem to worry about this and they think it is regular. I would prefer better service. I guess I should start shopping around.

I know that because I have shared hosting it can\u2019t be perfect but this is pretty bad. The tech support was actually very sympathetic and really want ed to help which made me feel better, but of course they tried to convince me to upgrade.
