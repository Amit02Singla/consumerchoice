My website isn't a behemoth, though, so I can't testify so much on that part. Value: As a renewing customer, I was a bit disappointed by the price they offered me for a 3 years hosting.\nI was seeing better offers elsewhere (and even for Bluehost NEW customers) so I decided to leave.

When I first subscribed it was a matter of pricing->feature value, but the cPanel experience was weak and the upgrade process was hit and miss. Over the past three years BlueHost has resolved any issues I had with them.\nThey're cPanel is greatly improved, they're feature set is much broader with few limitations, and with their new reseller account options I can host clients without any of the problems I used to run in to. BlueHost's cPanel in particular is where the best value comes. When I started my subscription with them I was less than savvy about many things relating to hosting or marketing or anything else that would otherwise lead to solid web presence.\nThere are many included tools and promotions that BlueHost provides with the subscription that put me on the right track and led to more opportunities as I matured. Technical expertise is not a requirement as BlueHost has most of those tools available to you, but there is still enough flexibility for more savvy developers to get their hands dirty. The only one quorum I have is a lack of root level access, but that isn't a dealbreaker for myself personally.\nOverall I'd consider BlueHost as one of my favorite webhosts. There are others I've tried, but BlueHost has been the most reliable and their customer service team has always been quick and knowledgeable. For those who want a simple but reliable experience then BlueHost is the way to go; those who want complete control over their experience may not like how BlueHost does things.\n\n                        \u00a0\n                    ", "picture_urls": ["https://media.whoishostingthis.com/2/v245/images/host-logos/bluehost.png"]}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "3", "reviewed_at": null, "review_title": null, "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "Abby  Brown", "absolute_url": "https://www.whoishostingthis.com/hosting-reviews/bluehost/", "website_name": ["Who Is Hosting This small logo"], "review_text": "\n            Bluehost support is bad.

I am also using the Cloudflare CDN which BlueHost and it has really improved the site's loading speed.So far, my site has been down only for once and that was just a few days after I switched to BlueHost. However, their customer support was fast in responding to my issue and they got it resolved within half an hour.\nSince then, I haven't faced any issues with my site. Another good thing about BlueHost is their Control Panel. It is easy to use and user-friendly.\nBluehost's control panel also provides additional services like SEO based services and CloudFlare integration. I'll definitely upgrade to better plans at Bluehost once my website begins to generate more traffic.

I always give their support team kudos. However, in the past year, their email is getting worse and worse.\nTheir servers are black listed and they don't do anything about it. They respond with \"Try sending it again in an an hour when the servers rotate.\" This affects everyone in my business. We are working and with this kind of terrible service, we never know if your email goes through to a client or customer.\nTheir excuse is that email servers are shared so things like this happen. When I point out that email has been this way since before AOL and companies like AOL, gmail and others seem to deliver email just fine, the rep always seems to finally admit the senior management at Bluehost is not funding email support to force people to buy paid email services. IMO, email is a cost-of-doing-business type of feature.\nMeaning if I buy a car, a steering wheel is a cost-of-doing-business feature. I have a car (Bluehost) and it used to have steering wheel one hundred percent of the time. Now, the steering wheel is only there 70 of the time while I am driving.\nI then call the service department, they tell me it's not a safety risk. I should keep the car but get an Uber (Paid Gmail) to be able to get to work every day for reliability and safety. My answer is no thanks.\nI just get any other car on the market, even one like GoDaddy which I hate, and get a working steering wheel.

They assigned me a temporary domain name which support told me would last from 25 minutes to 5 hours.

The person on chat never seemed to understand my problem. I even copied and pasted the error message from their site that explained the situation but to no avail.\nI couldn't see how my blog looked or access email while the domain remained with a temporary address. On Sunday I tried 2 more times with live chat but couldn't get my problem resolved. I tried again on Monday and after chatting for a few minutes I realized that I wasn't going to have my problem resolved and asked for a refund.\nThe person took my information and said that I would be getting my refund. The refund hadn't been posted to my credit card account on Tuesday so I called customer support and talked to a person who understood my original problem and offered to solve it. I said no, I would just like to get my refund.\nThey told me that I wouldn't be getting the refund for my domain name purchase because the person who was processing the refund on Monday didn't complete the process and it had been more than 3 days since I had purchased the domain name and they would only refund that purchase during the first 3 days. (By the way, Tuesday was 3 days after Saturday) I received an email detailing my refund (less the price paid for the domain name) on Tuesday but it hadn't been posted to my credit card on Wednesday. I filed a claim with the credit card company and they have issued me a provisional credit. I know that stuff happens but when a problem is brought to the attention of a support person the problem should be worked on.\nThe live chat people should have been able to solve my problem or pushed it up to someone who could.

I use their WordPress hosting service and I am satisfied with the service, although there are some flaws.\nPros:\n-Easy setup\n-Very good uptime (all the time)\n-Good speed\nCons:\n-Support is not great\n-The price is higher than other hosting\nDuring my last semester of teaching I was approached by one of my students who said he could optimize my site and get many more readers quickly, but found some security flaws in the site which should be fixed first. He offered to fix it himself for free, but first I contacted support. They did not do much and claimed the site was in good standing with security.\nThey have their own \"intrusion detection/prevention system\" which stops their service from getting hacked, but I found out it doesn't actually protect my website. I reluctantly let the student fix my site after giving him my account details and he managed to find all kinds of flaws from the inside as well. He fixed most of them within a couple of days, from bad configuration, bad plugins, and hiding my personal email/account.\nI'm not very good with this kind of stuff but was astonished by how much the student was able to do that BlueHost was not able to do. The student also showed me that there were much cheaper hosting plans I could have gotten, and sure enough he was right, so I don't think the value is great for this host. Other than all that, the first setup of the website was really easy, only a few clicks and it was ready.

I currently host my own blog and the blogs for some friends. There were occasionally tricky things, such as figuring out that I needed to make sure my IP was whitelisted when I wanted to remote access the MySQL database - but once I made a note in my config to remember that, it hasn't been a problem.\nThere were some points when it seemed that the page loading times were a bit slow, but I have not noticed that recently. The main reason for my high review is that when I received the renewal notice (I appreciate the 3-month, 2-month and 1-month warnings - I don't act on them immediately) I was quite shocked that the renewal price (about $11.99/mo) was more than double my initial price (about $4.99/mo). I did some research and found out that this was because it had been a promotion for new customers, etc.\nI was all set for going with another host, but before I bit the bullet, I decided to contact BlueHost customer service. To make a long story short, after I explained the situation, the customer service agent spoke to a manager and then came back to say they would offer me a renewal price that actually was a few pence cheaper than my initial price 3 years ago - the moral of the story being, you don't ask, you don't get! I was happy to sign on for another 36 months at that price, having had no major complaints about the service, and preferring to avoid the hassle of switching to another host (for the medium package, no one else beat the price anyway).\nI recently set up a couple of new simple blogs and it was very quick to do and use. I'm not sure if someone requiring business hosting will find all their needs met by BlueHost, but in my case as someone hosting a few personal sites for myself and friends, I have no complaints - and I appreciate BlueHost's valuing me as a customer by offering me a good deal. \n\n                        \u00a0\n                    ", "picture_urls": []}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "4.5", "reviewed_at": null, "review_title": null, "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "David Rhoderick", "absolute_url": "https://www.whoishostingthis.com/hosting-reviews/bluehost/page-2/", "website_name": ["Who Is Hosting This small logo"], "review_text": "\n            I have been using BlueHost for 2 years now. While it is true, I was lured in by an attractive low-rate offer, when the price rises, it doesn't go above what other hosts offer, so it's still a discount. The first thing that stands out regarding BlueHost is that I receive by far the best customer support, at least by chat, that I can think of in any form of business.\nThey are always available within 20 minutes, which is fine because the chat box pings when they are ready, so I'm never just waiting on hold, I am free to do something else while waiting. When they respond, they are knowledgeable and helpful and I always get my questions answered, whether it is a developer-type technical question or simply about billing. The second best thing is the interface.\nIt is clean and the blue branding is beautiful. It is easy to use and offers me tons of control. The only negative, why I dropped stars for features, is that on a shared system, there is no way to run a Java application on my server.\nOtherwise, between using cPanel, Sequel, and Cyberduck, it is a breeze connecting to the server and moving files around.

After experiencing what there is to offer on the shared plan, I believe for the price you pay (which is usually between $3.95 -$.5.95/month depending on what price you see it at) is an above average level of service that you get out of their hosting. You get an unlimited amount of bandwidth, databases, space (even though it does have a limit but to hit that you must be doing some heavy file storage, or a boatload of websites.) If you're going to setup a Wordpress site the one click install for it is handy along with the many other quick installs they offer, but it's nothing that any other host doesn't have.\nThe downtime on the servers can be weird at times. One thing that I still ponder to this day is how a hosting companies website goes down as well, and for periods of time that I contest to be unacceptable, and can contribute to a loss to any business running on their servers about 1-2 times per year. I believe the trouble with the downtime that they have is that they share their hosting servers with their sister hosting companies such as HostGator, and a few others that the parent company had brought into their happy hosting family (even if they deny the fact of being associated together, but it's no coincidence that Hostgator is down the same time as BlueHost each time it does go down).\nOther than that, the hosting for BlueHost is again, above average. Customer Service: 5/5 stars\n One thing that I must say though is that their customer service has always been there to answer questions that I have had at all times of the day, and night. They are very helpful, friendly people who will do everything they can to help you figure out an issue that you may have, even if it doesn't fall under the category of it being their problem.\nOne thing though, make sure that you have an adequate amount of time to wait late nights U.S times, because it seems that they are only staffing a few people if not one person on at those times, so expect anywhere from right away to 25 minute waiting periods. Just don't forget that you have that extra window open, because nothing is more frustrating than forgetting you had it open and the person leaves because you're not responding. Price: 3/5 stars\nThe pricing for their product aren't the best deals if you attempt to go past the shared hosting subscription.\nBuying a domain name from here would be silly for anyone to do considering you can always go to GoDaddy.com and use some coupon code to get one for 0.99 - 2.99 all day long. The rest of the products are priced as they are in many other places.

Firstly I wasted over a year on their shared hosting that constantly throttled my sites. I went down from 300 to 500 visitors a day to maybe 150 per day.\nGoogle stopped sending me traffic as some pages would take up to 19 secs to load. Then I decided to move over to VPS and this was the final straw. After less than 24 hours my site went down and although I started up tickets and received automated responses, I never had a human get in touch after repeated emails, Online chat was unavailable after moving to VPS and my only option was to phone them.\nBeing from the UK, I decided to cut my losses and give up on hosting. Before my sites went down, I'd luckily decided to mirror my site on Blogger. When my VPS went down I lost all my images, as they were being hot-linked from Bluehost, but I'm happy to go through my entire site as long as I don't have to suffer by the likes of Bluehost.\nMy advice is stay clear of this company. In my experience, they're a complete waste of time, as their customer care was none existent for me. Since moving to Blogger my site has risen in rank from just under 2 million to 700 near thousand.\nMy page speeds, even on image intense posts, are under 5 secs.

We lost thousands of dollars in our worth of time by trying to fix their mistake.\nWe finally received help from a tech who said that normally, the hosting company would not support switching over files from the backend which is ridiculous since everything that was supposed to be switched over from one server to the other was not switched over by them! Our websites were down for two days at this point and while this sixth tech helped us, he had to cap his time because bluehost would not allow him to help us any further - I am completely outraged and disappointed that \"upgrading\" was like \"downgrading\" because we are paying more for hosting in which they broke links, plugins, switched around other various files that did not exist before, and did not wish to fix their mistake. The thing that really got to me was when I was giving the supervisor feedback, all he said was that the support could not help us any more because our website developer should have known how to fix this.\nWell, 1. how would the website developer know what the server was in the beginning that we used versus the one that they changed it to? 2. Why couldn't the first five of your tech guys identify this issue if this is such a routine change?\nHe had no answer to the first question and to the second question he just said that the last tech we talked to had to delve \"deeper\" and that is why he could not stay helping us - how does that answer my second question? He was no help at all and just basically said well now that you know how we messed up Your Site, you can fix it now. I definitely do not suggest going to the hosting company because the customer service is horrible, and don't upgrade if you want the same quality of service that you get before you upgrade.\n\n                        \u00a0\n                    ", "picture_urls": []}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "1", "reviewed_at": null, "review_title": null, "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "Dave", "absolute_url": "https://www.whoishostingthis.com/hosting-reviews/bluehost/page-2/", "website_name": ["Who Is Hosting This small logo"], "review_text": "\n            I've signed up with dozens of webhosts through the years and Never had this much trouble setting up a new account - and None of them have asked for a copy of my driver's license and credit card!!

Generally speaking, this hosting is considered to be an awesome hosting. High as its price is, the performance is exciting.\nHere I will make a comprehensive evaluation of Bluehost. Fame\nIt is generally acknowledged that bluehost is a Superb Hosting provider, which is recommended by wordpress.org. Established in 1996, its experience and reputation are much superior to other hosting providers, which is a crucial reason for me to choose Bluehost.\nCustomer Service\nLive chat, ticket and telephone consist of 24/7 customer service. The problem can be solved rapidly by means of live chat. And you will get a reply in ten minutes if submit a ticket.\nUptime\nHardly am I satisfied with the network uptime of Bluehost, which scarcely reach 99.9% that they guarantee. It is always down couples of times every month. According to the statistics from jiankongbao.com, there is only one month in which the network uptime percentage is more than 99.9%(January, 2011, 99.97%, down only 1 minute).\nAccordingly, fortune, to a large extent, is a significantly indispensable factor when you purchase a web hosting. Value\nNumerous hosting provider maintain a policy that paying a little money for first purchase, but considerably higher price when you renew it. Bluehost is not a exception.\nFrom promotion link, it only costs $59.4 every year($4.95 per month). Nevertheless, when you want to renew it, you will find that it cost $107.4 per year($8.95 per month) for one-year-duration. But it is worthy to buy it.\nFeatures\nSimpleScripts, one-click script installs, is a not only excellent but also convenient tool to install trementous quantities of scripts. Free shared SSL can be used by small commercial websites.

I left Fatcow (ugh) because of very Very poor support that liked to blame it all on you for any failures. in the end my website was always going down.\nBlamed me but it always turned out to be them..every time. I am using the Cloud service with Bluehost. Uptime has been 99.9%.\nthe chat support is sourced overseas. the phone support is USA based. I got alot more accomplished by phone.\nThe chat support has no clue whats going on. The wait time has been 10-20 minutes and on one occasion 30 minutes. thats FAR too long for me so thats why I am not happy with support.\nThe price is very reasonable and I always look to what the renewable coast will be...not what first year entry is. ignore that. thats just the cherry on top.\nAnyway, I am not a fan of cpanel because i learned my way around using the vdeck. Also alot of pages in their site to jump around to. To me its unorganized but..i get where i need to be by following the same path each time.\ni use Weebly pro and Bluehost is the Only webhost that has NOT upgraded their weebly. Very disappointed in this and have complained repeatedly. Zero replies from their feedback emails.\ni have sent in atleast 6 emails requesting them to upgrade this. i have gone ignored which pisses me off. the cpanel sometimes has issues loading weebly as well..but provides a link for it if it isnt.\nugh..another link to click on. Andddd to explain why it is important to me for them to upgrade weebly is..the old version of weebly publishes the Entire site. The newer weebly software Only publishes what changes you made..making it fast when publishing.\nI have a large website and it takes hours to publish then sometimes it takes 2-3 times before it shows to have gone through. If they would upgrade weebly, i would be tickled pink. But right now I am on the fence about leaving Bluehost because of this one issue.\nIf you dont use weebly then their wont be an issue i am sure. I am afraid to go elsewhere too because of so many up and down reviews of other webhosts. I have tried SiteGround and Host Gator.\nThey wouldnt let me rebuild my site without moving it over to them immediately...meaning my down time would be 2-4 weeks. thats how long it would take me to rebuild it. Its about 500 pages.\nso I left them and Bluehost allowed me to do this so I had Zero downtime. So its tricky to find the right webhost that will offer what you are looking for. Everyone is looking for something different and so reviews are not really something to go by.\nI mean the star ratings. you need to Read the reviews and see what others are complaining about. It is obvious some of these people have no clue what they want or need and just complain.\nSo that makes the star rating go up or down. sad to say really. I think all you can do is make an effort to call and speak to someone on the phone to get fast answers and solutions.\nWaiting for an email/ticket is not a high priority way to contact them. Call!!!!!! Is there a place to leave reviews about websites?\nCause I sure see some really horrible websites that people actually think are acceptable. Scream.

However, I decided to choose BlueHost and it turned out to be a terrible mistake.\n1. In the first few days of joining BlueHost, my website was down at least five times and in the customer support, when I told them about the problem, they didn't know how to fix it or they didn't see anything wrong yet my website was clearly down!\nThe times my website was up, it lagged a lot and was loading slowly most of the time, yet there was little to no content on the site itself! If anyone is looking to get serious with their website. BlueHost is definitely NOT the way to go.\n2.\nAlthough the customer service was quite fast, it seemed to me, that the people there didn't know much more than I did. They couldn't fix any problems I had or they couldn't find the issue.\n3. I didn't get 100% of my money back when canceled.\nThey didn't give me a full refund although on their landing page, they say clearly that there is a 100% money back guarantee. I got about $10 less, and when I contacted about my issue, they always tried to somehow change topic to make me buy their service again or make me leave. They were not helpful.\nI ended up losing my money and I consider this a scam as they just took the money for nothing.\n4. There were many features in BlueHost cpanel, yet most of them were completely useless and an average person would have nothing to do with them. All I needed was to install WordPress and from there, I only used what WordPress offered and nothing to do with BlueHost.\nHowever, despite all the negative there were a few good things about BlueHost you cannot find elsewhere:\n1. You get a Free domain when signing up with them, which is very great because you will save at least $10/year.\n2. It's very cheap and the best host for a low budget.\nConclusion: If you are on a low-budget, BlueHost is the way to go, however if you want to build a serious site with no downtime and make sure everything is running how it's supposed to, then BlueHost is the worst choice you could make.

He believed that anyone with basic computer skills could design a site that way, so according to him - it was scam.\nThey need to make their design more professional.

Free ones won't do for my big ambitions. But I was not ready to spend out huge bucks.\nSo, after doing a lot of research when I was getting more and more confused I stumbled on to Bluehost. And believe me I am so happy I did. Cost- Though normally it costs 6.95$/month, I signed up through an offer from some site for 2 years at 3.95$/month.\nVery cheap in my opinion. Flavors- Unlike other hosts, Bluehost only has a single offer and gives almost everything you can ask in a shared hosting in it. What I got at 3.95$/month would have cost me 10$ at other hosts for sure.\nFeatures- You can host unlimited domains and get unlimited disc space and bandwidth. Surprised? No, they don't mean limited, its really unlimited.\nFair Usage Policy states that there is a limit on CPU usage at a time but bandwidth and disc space is really unlimited without any fineprints. You get all you need- Fanastico, Simplescripts, PHP, Perl, 50$ Adwords voucher, 25$ YSM and Miva each and more. Comes with the latest CPanel too.\nThe only little concern is that your MySQL is limited to 100 but who uses so much in a shared account anyway? Performance- Bluehost is fantastic in performance, Period. Never had any issues upto now.\nGood page load speed, fast script installations. I never got any downtime. A++\nSupport- Just needed to contact support twice and they were very knowledgeable and prompt.\nAnswered my queries instantaneously and were infact eager to help. Got my identity confirmed for Adwords code in minutes. Value- When I get features and performance of 10$/month host at 3.95$ you know its a steal.\nEven if I had bought it for 6.95$ it would have been a steal for that sum. Conclusion- If you are in need of a shared host with top notch performance, this is the one. Don't think about anything else.\nYou can search about its flaw. I guarantee you won't find any.

Support has always been great and helpful. Now they are still courteous, but not so helpful.\nPrior to a couple of months ago, I was able to go to Site Backup and Restore and download a zip file of my whole site plus the database. Then something happened, and I am unable to do that anymore. I even subscribed to BackupPro, thinking that if I paid (which I was OK with doing) I could get the cpanel backup again.\nNo, that didnt work either and I asked for my money to be refunded. I am getting errors when I go to download the zip file. I know they provide hosting for a minimum charge, but if a service is no longer going to be offered, all they have to do is say that.\nI can't seem to get any kind of straight answer about backups, except that, as I was told on my last call, that backups are a courtesy service and don't Have to be provided. I have noticed that my site runs very slow. Before I even signed up, I told tech support I was going to be hosting a site that sells hi rez images.\nThey said not a problem, I would not come anywhere near the limits, so go for it, which I did. Today, I notice that they are doing CPU throttling. I am very disappointed in what has happened at Bluehost the past couple of months.\n\n                        \u00a0\n                    ", "picture_urls": []}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "4", "reviewed_at": null, "review_title": null, "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "Ray Gauthier", "absolute_url": "https://www.whoishostingthis.com/hosting-reviews/bluehost/page-3/", "website_name": ["Who Is Hosting This small logo"], "review_text": "\n            We deal with several hosting companies since we build websites for clients but we aren't in the hosting business so we insist clients host their own sites.

No such problems with Bluehost- as a matter of fact, it's the company we recommend to our clients when they are looking for advice.\nThe support from Bluehost isn't the greatest but that's par for the course. The online chat support pretty normally has a 20 minute queue and then 5 minutes for them to \"get\" your issue. After that, once the catch on to the problem, they usually stick with you and have some good recommendations.\nFor $10 a month, you really can't expect much more than that. Speaking of $10 a month - it's very disappointing that the  low cost of entry (about $4 a month) expires after a year and raises significantly with no coupons available after the first year. For a small site, it's worth just getting a new $4 a month account and then moving everything over.\nSeems like a lot of work for them and for the consumer. The strategy might be working but it makes most of my clients \"shop\" every year. I'd recommend Bluehost look at a retention strategy to build long time loyalty that will help then get long time referrals.

It wasn't.\nWhen I signed up for Bluehost, and got activated, almost instantly, I was surprised at how quick the set up was. Just a few minutes later, after installing Wordpress to test out my new hosting, I was amazed at how fast the systems ran.

It is very easy to set up a site with them. Their prices are very cheap, and they don't bury you with tons of different hosting plans.\nIn fact there is just one! They offer most of the basics for getting Your Site up like Cpannel with Fantastico. The not so good:\nJust because they plaster the words \"unlimited\" all over their front page, do not be fooled!\nThey cap almost everything to ensure you don't use too many resources. They cap how much CPU you can use, how many processes you use. They limit the emails you can send out to only 50.\nThey limit the number and size of files you can store on the server. And they will not let you store any files that are not related to your websites (ie. you cannot use Bluehost as online storage)\nTheir online support is not very good.\nHowever the quickest way to get in contact with Bluehost is through the Live chat feature on their front page. Once connected, they handle basic questions very well, but ask a more complicated question that requires work on their part and suddenly you realize how competent their support staff is. Their email/ticket based support is a joke.\nDon't expect to get an answer anytime soon using this method.

Also, Bluehost is great if you are looking for a cheap hosting solution. Bluehost is not so great if you want good or even mediocre support, or if your site consumes even a fair amount of server CPU/resources. \n\n                        \u00a0\n                    ", "picture_urls": []}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "2.5", "reviewed_at": null, "review_title": null, "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "Steven v.d.

All of they worked good but to manage them better I decided to move everything on one new and good hosting... After reading good Bluehost reviews, I chose to go with Bluehost.\nWithin 1 month all of my websites got Malware. I get call from Sitelock saying we have been notified that your websites are infected by Malware so please contact us Asap. I called and they asked me to approx $125 for each domain.\nI said no I will look into it. Next day Bluehost deactivated my account saying it is violating terms and conditions. I called Bluehost and asked about deactivation.\nThe Bluehost showed me the file that lists the file that are infected. I manually went through each file and deleted all extra files that were reported. Within 1 month I again got call from Sitelock saying ssame thing and the whole cycle repeated...\nMy websites are 12-15 pages static websites. They were live from last 4-5 years and nothing happened. Bluehost say we don't know what is wrong with your websites.\nTo fix it please contact our partner SiteLock.

At the time bluehost looked great, and I bought their mid range server at $199/month, this price was great for me.

This means I have experienced waits of up to 30 minutes to get some support. But to be fair the support I have received is good, it\u2019s just accessing it that can be hard.\nBut on Friday august 2nd it all went horrible! I mean horrible! On august 1st I had launched my next large website, and within 24 hours it had gained over 3000 members and got over 50,000 visits, I expected this launch to get even bigger on August 2nd and I expected my new site to grow even more at a faster rate.\nBut\u2026 It didn\u2019t. Why? Bluehost suffered a massive outage causing all my websites to go down.\nMy sites were up and down for well over 36 hours, disrupting over 150,000 people that tried to access my sites. It completely screwed over the launch of my new website and it screwed my established websites. After 24 hours of repetitive tweets on twitter from bluehost saying \u201cit will be resolved soon\u201d I thought enough was enough and I decided to look for a new dedicated server company.\nIt is now august 4th and I have a new server with liquid web and they specialize in dedicated servers so their support is amazing and I have already had my sites migrated from bluehost by their migration team. But also today a new problem has emerged. Due to my websites being down I have lost my google rankings and dropped from being #1 to past the second page!\nMy daily revenue has also decreased by over 50%! Meaning bluehost has totally caused my business to go down hill. Now I\u2019m on a new server I hope I will regain my rankings and revenue, but for now I am very annoyed with bluehost.

Because Blueshost does not notify you of server outages.\nThe other two times I happened to catch. Their chat support is horrendous.

I love it, and still, I am using their services.\nLet's talk about shared hosting of Bluehost. Bluehost does not offer month-to-month shared hosting plan. Instead, this requires you to register for a yearly plan.\nIf you enroll in a two-year or three-year system, you get discounts. If you commit to staying put for three years, the service's $3.95 per month rate is attractive. Bluehost's hosting packages come with a 30-days money back guarantee, free domain.\nBluehost offers 24/7 telephone support, online chat, a ticket based system.

Features: One of the good thing I really like about bluehost is their C-Panel. Their C-Panel interface is very easy to navigate and a non-techie person like me can easily pick the right tools (one click WordPress install) at the right time to use.\nUptime: I haven't had faced any major issue up till  now. They promised to give me 99.9% uptime and I didn't notice any issue with uptime. Yes, after every few months they update their server and they send pre-notice about the downtime for few hours, which is acceptable.\nValue: Great value comes with any subscription.

I've chatted with their staff a few times, my issues are usually resolved at professional manner.\nThese guys know what they are doing!

The tools it offers are famous for combating the security threats. You can prevent the spam with ease by using the spamassassin tool.\nIt supports cloudfare that helps to defend the Ddos attacks. Plus the hotlink protection prevents content stealing and also allows you to block IPs & secure web sessions. The integration of apps makes it more user friendly.\nAnd on top of all these features, it provides 99% proven uptime. I am not saying this with my mind, I've personally tested it. The majority of hosts there claims to give 99% uptime but most of them failed to provide even 70%.\nBut bluehost server time is the best thing about it. It makes bluehost stands out. I personally like it the most.\nEvery thing has pros and cons. Some of the cons of bluehost includes the slow speeds(very rare), like others it is also not truly unlimited, expensive starter guide and the bad customer support. If we sum up the pros and cons then I would say that nobody is perfect.\nSo in finding the perfect, you'll lose your main point of digital journey.

During one call I was transferred to 5 different people and had to relay the same information over and over again and even then the website was not reactivated after this call. All we needed at this time was how to submit a chargeback to BH.\nEventhough the website was up and running our company emails were not and still not. The second issue we had was getting a new email address associated with our BH account. This was definitely not an easy task as they require government issued ID, bank statement from when you made the original purchase with BH, photo of the credit card used.\nThe third problem was that BH's credit card company charged us twice for this year. When I asked the helpdesk via live chat if they could ask the credit card company to refund it, the agent suggested to speak to their credit card company and said that they have \"reported the repayment and that this dispute was resolved.\" When I asked if they could provide their credit card company details so I can speak to them and get this sorted, I was told:\" I don't know. I don't work for the credit card company.\" Astute observation.\nSubsequently, I requested the agent to ask his team members for the information he replied: \"It is not our requirement to provide contact info to a customer's credit card company.\" If you suggest I speak to your credit card company should you not provide their contact details to me? He did give one very helpful tip which was that the team who usually correspond with the credit card company are not in today and they are back in the office on Monday. Do yourself a favour and look for another hosting company if you are considering BlueHost. \n\n                        \u00a0\n                    ", "picture_urls": []}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "1.5", "reviewed_at": null, "review_title": null, "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "Suthan Bala", "absolute_url": "https://www.whoishostingthis.com/hosting-reviews/bluehost/page-4/", "website_name": ["Who Is Hosting This small logo"], "review_text": "\n            Absolute worst uptime.

Unfortunately, it was downhill from then on.

To cut a long story short and after a couple of attempted Support chats and tickets, it turned out that the server supposed to be hosting my new site was down. Not a good first impression!\nWhat bothered me was not just that the servers were down and stayed down for 24 plus hours (down even at the time of writing this review!) but also the service level of the tech support. Not only is the chat wait far longer than pre-sales but the staff are obviously so overwhelmed that you can get bumped off the chat session for no reason, simply to bolster their 'completed' sessions I suppose. One ticket response I had said \"The server is down.\nWe have no ETA\". Hmmm. I was a new customer, why not allocate another server?\nI tried a number of different avenues to resolve the issues but there was a stonewall in each case. The feeling quickly grew that I couldn't trust BlueHost with my customers and decided to cancel the plan and the extras I had ordered through them.

If I knew- I could have used my own existed domain name rather than using a new one. Interesting part is that before I purchase the service I did ask about all the fees that may be involved in canceling and everyone assured me that I lose the cost of hosting on the months I used it- and that's all.\nWhen I complaint about the 11.99, they said it is written in the terms and condition I agreed on.

At a client's request I recently had to move a site I developed on Bluehost to Godaddy for hosting.\nThe interaction with the technical support team at Godaddy only served to confirm my brilliant decision to move to you.

They eventually told me that they could not help me because they do not support Wordpress issues.\nThey said I had to figure it out on my own.

While other hosting providers provides a cheaper offer at $4.99/month or same as it, compared by the number of features offered, Bluehost comes first at only $6.95/month at unlimited databases and emails. The same unlimited plan costs $14.99/month at Godaddy.\nBluehost is Cheaper! While every hosting provider has periods of downtime, I have noticed about the same down-time for both, whenever they have a maintenance going on. The sites powered by WordPress are loading noticeable faster on Bluehost.\nHere, I refer mainly at the time the connection is made to database, before even the site is being loaded. At other providers, that waiting is longer by 1-3 seconds depending on the database size. I do not even want to mention the hosting provider FatCow and Godaddy  etc.\nwhere this waiting time is 15-20 seconds! Bluehost is Faster! In case you want to have plug-ins or additional functionality running properly, DON\u2019T sign up with any others providers!\nI remember I had a very bad experience in the past, when a client of mine wanted a newsletter software installed on his Godaddy server. I managed to install it, but than, it would not send mass emails. Testing the same functionality on Bluehost, it worked with no problems.\nSpeaking with Godaddy technical support, they told me we need to upgrade the account and pay like $150/month, so we can have that feature supported! No thanks. Bluehost has more features configured and installed!\nAnother bitter experience with Godaddy, it was when we have lost information on a website we were developing, with no manual back-up at that time. After we figured out some problems with the content and that after few days, we found out that Godaddy only stores the back-ups for 1 day. If you need to go to an earlier date, their programmers need to go in there manually and restore it for you for the cost of $150.\nYour mistake your pay! In exchange, on Bluehost they store the back-ups for 30 days so you don\u2019t even have to worry about using your own back-up manager. Bluehost is more trusted!\nGodaddy plays dirty! For some unexplained reason, on Godaddy, whenever we make a fresh install of WordPress we need to wait at least 30 minutes for the database and username to get created. In case you need to change the FTP password you need to wait another 30 minutes, waiting precious time just waiting when you have that deadline in few days.\nI haven\u2019t heard of such non-sens on other hosting providers including Bluehost. Bluehost saves developers time! Both companies respond in pretty quick to phone calls, however on Godaddy the waiting is higher due is a large company with more clients.\nWhat I liked on Bluehost, is that sometimes they do things for you and they really want to help without charging you extra. On Godaddy, they always try to up-sell or have no clue about my problem. Bluehost support is more professional!\nAfter all! Bluehost is the winner! I use Bluehost now and will be in future.

Check the site monitor report here for yourself. http://sysojo.com/stats/11794\nAfter suspended from Bluehost on April 7, 2011, I moved to InMotion hosting same day and you can see the site was never down for even a single second.\nFrom March 19 to April 7, ste was down many times in day, the maximum being 4 hours in a day and minimum is 10 minutes. site url: http://www.kochituskers.in\nSo think yourself, if your webiste is hosted to attract visitors, Bluehost will suspend your account for traffic.

With a nice low fee, a great uptime, and the features of the major hosts; what more can you get from a website host? BlueHost may put you on a shared server but having a OS-48 BackBone server an almost 100% uptime, and a low amount of users on each shared server you almost forget your on a shared server after purchasing your account.\nSupport Wise, BlueHost has been known for having one of the biggest and fastest customer support times in the industry with their sister site HostMonster. For live support time I usually do not have to wait more than 10 minutes, phone wise the longest hold time I have received was three minutes. The way they handle your problems, issues, or concerns are one of a real host that will be here for years; they are no doubt the A+ on the hosting test for myself.\nProblems are fixed at max within 24 hours and they usually have an answer for everything; no more hosting with lies. BlueHost and HostMonster are really for customers with a little more than higher knowledge of how to upload, update, and edit using FTP and the program cPanel. Accessing and editing Your Site is instant; no delay factors at all from purchasing to starting your website.\nI just recommend you understand FTP and cPanel; this is not the host if your looking for a website editing program like FreeWeb's because you will not receive it. The only one problem I have received with BlueHost would have too be one server offline charted; and it was for 5 minutes, no biggie. BlueHost is a host I would no doubt reccomend to friends, family, enemies, anyone I come in contact with looking for a website host.\nNot only are they affordable as stated above the features are just great. The only problem you may have is SSH/Shell Access is NOT instant; you will need to fax them your photo ID in order to activate this feature. On a scale of 1 to 10 to rate this host to rap up; I would rate it a 105 without hesitation.\n\n                        \u00a0\n                    ", "picture_urls": []}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "4.5", "reviewed_at": null, "review_title": null, "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "sabrina Barnett", "absolute_url": "https://www.whoishostingthis.com/hosting-reviews/bluehost/page-4/", "website_name": ["Who Is Hosting This small logo"], "review_text": "\n            I have been using for Bluehost hosting from the last 4 Months and I just faced only 1 issue till now which gets solved by the support team in 1 hour.

Half a day later I got an email saying that my application is incomplete. They asked my scan my Credit Card and send it to them.\nWTF? Done it. Late in the night seeing that I get no answer from them, I contact them to see what's going on.\n'The next operator will be available in 15 minutes.' WTF?\nFinally I get to speak with someone: 'Wrong department. Please hold while we transfer you'. Finally I get a real human to speak with.\nThey told me they lost my email (the one with the credit card). So I need to scan it again and send it over. 'We will contact you later'. It was already late Saturday in USA and they Dont offer support Sunday.\nI was prepared to buy yet another hosting from a different company. As backup. In case BlueHost screw it.\nAfter waiting another day, they slap me hard again:  they asked my ID also. So, yet another day for them to process the new document and YET another day to receive the answer: your application has been rejected, your charge will be refunded in 7-14 days!

Weeks go and nothing happens.\nMy contact there says 'he is not sure what is happening but will check with the site migration team.\" After several more confusing and contradictory emails he said it was all fixed and the two sites (Mason Harris photography.com and pagan photos.com) were now combined under one hosting package. When I check Mason Harris photography.com however today (Saturday 21 May) the site is effectively crippled. Nothing is showing except some Html index code.\nI have lost all content and WordPress templates. Nobody at Bluehost is able to help me as their site migration team doesn't work weekends despite their promise of seven day technical support.

After giving Bluehost more business and being promised an easy 'streamlining' of two site hosting packages into one - and after paying them extra to take care of the technicalities for me - I have been left with a crippled website and no idea what is happening.\nEven more worryingly, every person I speak to Has no record of my previous correspondence or payments.

I'll start with Customer Service which I believe to be an important factor with a hosting account. This is Bluehosts' weakest point.\nThere are a number of issues that contribute to this weakness. Not all their tech support technicians are knowledgeable  or qualified, you will likely have to make 2+ contacts before having your issue(s) resolved. You will be given wrong, different, and incorrect information until you reach someone that is knowledgeable.\nWait times are extremely long and the chat wait time calculator is essentially meaningless. Once you do get a tech they will likely be working with a number of other customers, which likely contributes to faulty information because you are dealing with a distracted tech. To add insult to injury, a large focus of their support will be an attempt to up-sell you to some other service that will supposedly resolve your issue.\nIn my opinion Bluehost customer service is utterly worthless. With respect to features, you get a reasonable amount of features for the money, but in this regard they are not really offering anything most everyone doesn't also offer. You will have to pay extra for useful features, particularly those dealing with Spam.\nThe price is fair, the $3.95 listed is not accurate. Monthly price is between $6.99 - $7.99 a month for standard hosting, which is on par with their competition. Again, drawback is you'll pay extra for additional features, so plan on paying about $10+ a month.\nYou get one free domain registration with your account which is a fairly standard feature. I would not recommend using Bluehost for Domain Name Registration as their pricing is high and there are plenty of other companies that provide this service for much less. With respect to uptime, I haven't noticed any issues here and this seems to be something their pretty good at.\nTheir strongest feature is their CPanel, which is very user friendly and pretty easy to navigate. For those that are not technically savvy this is a big plus. Back when Bluehost used to have good customer service I would recommend them to my customers regularly for this very reason.\nIn sum, their pricing is fair but given their horrible and almost useless customer service you will be better served somewhere else. I have hosting accounts with other providers which granted also have their issues but overall provide much better customer service and a bigger bang for the buck. Save yourself some frustration and stay away from these guys would be my advice.\n\n                        \u00a0\n                    ", "picture_urls": []}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "5", "reviewed_at": null, "review_title": null, "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "micheal richmond", "absolute_url": "https://www.whoishostingthis.com/hosting-reviews/bluehost/page-5/", "website_name": ["Who Is Hosting This small logo"], "review_text": "\n            my business knew no bounds since the day I got introduce to BlueHost, with 100% service uptime Bluehost stands out from the rest with great support and affordable services.\n\n                        \u00a0\n                    ", "picture_urls": []}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "5", "reviewed_at": null, "review_title": null, "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "Lis McGovern", "absolute_url": "https://www.whoishostingthis.com/hosting-reviews/bluehost/page-5/", "website_name": ["Who Is Hosting This small logo"], "review_text": "\n            Customer Service Rep John Boone was so extremely helpful for us today.

When I started out, the ease of use was beneficial, but their cPanel interface has always been pretty slow. In the last couple of weeks, this has been unbearable.\nFurther, when trying to re-route some domains to another hosting service last week, their interface kept timing out and mentioning service issues, even though their service status page listed no problems in the region and no problems on my server specifically. After an hour of hitting refresh and trying again and again, it eventually worked, but it almost cost me a client demo. Normally, bluehost's customer support is pretty good, but the above incident and their lack of information on service repairs and uptime has led me to give them a very negative rating.\nIf there is scheduled maintenance, I expect to be informed ahead of time. If there is unscheduled maintained, I expect to be informed of the issue and kept up to date on the status. Seeing a screen with \"try again soon\" from a serious hosting company is completely Unacceptable!\nIn short, bluehost has always been slow and it has been unbearable in the last month.

The 1 minute timer turned into 30 minutes of waiting - what's the point of a timer if it is not accurate. Then having eventually managed to chat to someone, it was painful waiting for their response to my questions.\nObviously they are dealing with multiple enquiries but never did I once feel that my issue was being taken seriously. I was promised by the 'technician' that my issue would be resolved in 2 hours, 4 hours later nothing. I contacted them again and was advised it would be overnight.\nI contacted them the following morning and the issue was still not resolved. So I decided to telephone them (from the UK) and advised that the issue would take 24 hours. Yes you guessed it 24 hours later and nothing.\nOn speaking to the 'technician' again he advised that they did not have enough information and yet on my previous call I spent 30 minutes going through the issue with them. Bloody hopeless. So despite my business being effected for nearly 48 hours, they decided to look into the issue - they were doing me a favour by putting me to the front of the queue even though I had been informed that this would be resolved within a few hours - how bloody good of them!!!\nObviously unhappy with the service that I have been provided I wished to raise a complaint - guess what - no supervisors or managers available and apparently no complaints department.

One of the best things i like about BlueHost is that their server is 99% reliable. That means that there are rarely some downtimes and when they are, they make sure to fix it asap!\nI like also how easy they make things when you want to sign up for them: smooth & easy registration process, many apps integrations, official wordpress.org intergration... And of course let's not forget their low pricing! But as i've said earlier, there are some cons that they should Definitively consider in order to gain more trust.\nOne of the things i hate about them is that the site is very slow in loading! And their customer service isn't the best (they should definitively look for a better customer service). And if you're just starting in building your website, i suggest that you learn how to host and manipulate things in your hosting first (there are a lot of youtube videos teaching this) and then apply for their service because their tutorials and walk-through videos are So expensive!

First off, the hosting options are numerous but well organized. There is Shared hosting, managed WordPress hosting, dedicated hosting, VPS hosting and all of the usual types.\nThe uptime is pretty good, and I have only seen one instance where the site was down, and it went back up shortly. You can purchase domains on BlueHost. Transferring domains is always a complication with hosts, and BlueHost is not an exception.\nIf you have a domain elsewhere, you can change the settings to point to your BlueHost website. I believe the limit is 5 domains for the cheapest plan. The support at Bluehost is pretty good.\nHowever the chat program they use is terrible. It is easy to forget that you are chatting with a support representative. The telephone support is okay, but not the best at helping users transfer domains.\nWe got a domain that was stuck, mid-transfer for about a week. However, it got fixed eventually. The cPanel for BlueHost works fine.\nIt has the usual things like creating FTP logins, managing emails, and anything else you can think of. BlueHost is a good host with the essential features necessary to create a great website. If I could afford it, I would be paying for a dedicated server at BlueHost to try out what it is like.\nOne major con with the shared hosting plan is that it is shared hosting. Because BlueHost is a popular host, the lowest price plan is the most used. This means that the servers for the shared hosting can be a bit boggy at times.\nThis is not really the fault of BlueHost, but there are literally over a thousand different sites on the server I am using. Some of the less popular hosts that offer shared hosting are much faster because the shared servers have less strain put on them. One thing I like about BlueHost it doesn't get too complicated.\nThere are many-many different plans, but everything is so organized and simplistic that anyone should be able to figure out how to set it up. If you have an issue, the support is available 24/7 to help you. BlueHost also has a bunch of (slightly pricey but quality) professional services.\nThere is Quick Start, which will help you get Your Site up and running, with 45 minute sessions of 80 dollars. Then, for 150 dollars, there is Site Transfer, in which they will migrate your websites from other hosts to BlueHost. The last is called Site Doctor, which is 250 dollars to fix problems such as hackers and malware to save your online presence.\nThese services are very professional, though I do not need the first one. When I need to migrate a website, I just FTP all of the content and export the MySQL databases, and then re-import them. When I encounter malware/redirects to malicious websites on my site, I fix the problem myself.\nHowever it is nice to know that these services are available, if absolutely necessary. My final statement: BlueHost rocks, because it is a great web host that offers really cheap pricing and services that much better quality then some other hosts that I have encountered.\n\n                        \u00a0\n                    ", "picture_urls": []}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "1.5", "reviewed_at": null, "review_title": null, "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "Bruce Martineau", "absolute_url": "https://www.whoishostingthis.com/hosting-reviews/bluehost/page-5/", "website_name": ["Who Is Hosting This small logo"], "review_text": "\n            Bluehost was recommended to me by a close friend who has used their service for many years.

After placing my website into production, I had some problems which I attributed to my own lack of experience. After I renewed my subscription for Bluehost website hosting recently, I received an email stating that my website had been suspended and would be deleted very soon if I didn't call them to rectify the situation.\nI spent 2 hours on hold with their Customer Service. When a representative finally answered the phone, I asked what the problem was. They hadn't even told me in the email.\nThe representative was rude and condesending from the getgo. He told me that my website had been hacked and nothing could be done. They would be deleting the website immediately.\nThey wouldn't give me any other information unless I signed up for their Support Services. Indeed, quite interestingly, my website was deleted the next day. I was not given any guidance about what I did to cause this problem (if I even did), and what could be done in the future to insure that this would not happen to my Business website again.\nIn my lengthy career in IT, I have dealt with large and small companies. Some of these have been IBM, Unisys, and Digital Equipment (DEC). At times, I would get a rare support person that wasn't interested, but I always was able to report the problem and a representative from the company would get back to me with a response and what steps had been taken to rectify the situation.\nBluehost has no such structure in place. I  have never experienced a company that has such an immature disregard for their clients! When attempting to contact Bluehost to report the incident, I could not get anyone to return my calls, emails, or letters.\nI was hung up on three times when making pointed requests to speak with any Management. Their business model obviously includes no regard for the Client. I now have to rebuild the company's website from scratch.\nI was able to manually save the thousands of posts that were on the website. All other content was lost. I have had no response from the company regarding any help or even an apology.\nI am amazed that they have any clients at all.

When trying to get ahold of tech support either by phone or by web, the wait time has never been less than 20min for me, and two times yesterday it was over 30 min. When finally connected all they could tell me is \"they're working on the servers, and that's all I can tell you, I'm kept in the dark too.\" So I waited over 30 min for that explanation to my website being down twice, and when trying to get ahold of manager I had to wait another 30 min.\nMy website has been down for about 48hrs, only on sporadically during this time. Honestly I don't monitor my website uptime as often as I should, so I can only imagine how much it's been down.

As background, I'm an experienced IT professional with more than 20 years in the business, and I'm using a premium VPS service from these folks. I've had very bad problems with the availability of their servers, which they tend to blame on Worpdress or other issues.\nWhen I can get into the root console, the problem is normally some script running on their side, or some misconfiguration on their side, rather than anything on the wordpress side of things. I also have the consistent experience of opening cases and having them tell me, \"this is your server, we don't maintain this stuff,\" while at the same time being denied access to the directories/etc. I would need to fix the problems.\nFor instance, some of my email accounts are dkim signed, others are not. I opened a case to have them all dkim signed, to which they first responded, \"what is dkim and why do you care,\" and then, \"we don't handle this, it's your problem because you're on a VPS.\" The reality is, however, I don't have access to the mail server to change anything about it -- it's completely on their side of the wall. Another instance, I consistently receive errors in upgrade scripts for various python modules, the cpanel, etc. -- I receive emails notifying me that things can't be upgraded because specific directories or files can't be found, etc.\nI can't access the directory the script is in, nor the missing directories, yet when I open a case, I receive a reply that Bluehost doesn't manage VPS servers almost instantly. If I can't manage it, and they won't manage it, then I guess it's just an unmanaged service. For the price I'm paying -- about $600 a year -- this seems more than a little insane.\nFurther, their support personnel hang up on you if they're done -- the line just goes dead, or the chat ends, even if you're in the middle of saying or typing something -- and they feel free to insult their customers. \"Maybe you're just not smart enough to handle this sort of hosting solution,\" to quote one of their customer support folks directly.

When I asked them if Awstats was also moved the person told me no. I was very upset and eailed them back.\nThen another support person replied and apologized on behalf of the other guy who was not trained yet. I can give more and more examples like that.

Their plan at the time seemed reasonably priced, but I quickly learned that I was paying too much in many ways...\n1. Around the time that I got my account, their servers were hacked where my site automatically rerouted somewhere else.\nWhen I complained to them about this, the first denied any responsibility (it's Your server guys, it is Your responsibility to protect it). After fighting with them for a while, they told me the only way I could protect it was to get a dedicated IP address from them. This took my initial \"relatively inexpensive\" rate and pushed them into a much higher price bracket that I didn't expect.\n2.\nWhen I signed up, I was told that they would back up my account - when their server crashed, I asked them to restore my system and they refused to do so. At that point I started making weekly backups of my files when they started to threaten me that they would terminate my account if I continued to do so. If these clowns would have done their jobs, I would not have had to do that.\n3.\nIn general, their online and phone support is beyond abysmal. Every time I contact them, I get some snarky jerk who acts like my questions are beneath him and tells me that he can't help me.

When I sent their support an e-Mail to help me solve it, they ignored me. I wrote back three times at which time they told me to simply reinstall PHP.\nThat did NOT solve the problem. I am still waiting for them to solve it now.

Question: Do I retain one bluehost account?\nor do i retain the hostgator account and close the 2 bluehost accounts. I've already decided what which one I'll retain and I'd like to offer my experience with both companies. so you can use to decide.\nincase you are comparing the two. Robustness & Reliability:\nWhen bluehost goes down - it can do so for 15 minutes to two hours. This can suck if you are in the middle of a launch or a serious paid campaign.\nThis has happened severally for the last 5 years. incidentally one account can be down and the other is not. so it depends with the neighborhood you are set in.\nHostgator. I can't say it doesn't go down. but atleast I've never noticed.\nI've been with them for the last 2 years. Technical support\nwith bluehost It's hard to find one support agent offering a comprehensive solution. with their live support you can be transferred multiple times across departments.\nand each agent doesnot read previous input in the chat. they ask how can i help. so you start the story all over again.\nBluehost live chat takes a long time before an agent attends you. on 26th dec 2012 i waited nearly 27 minutes before i could get an agent to attend to me. who later told me that he can't help because the issue relates to billing and the dept.\nwill open in 4 hours time . which i find ridiculous for a company with international customers plus all the time difference e.t.c. Hostgator - the technical team know their stuff.\nplus they are willing to even login and adjust some settings for you at no extra cost. compared to bluehost they tell you to hire a webmaster or follow the neatly designed tutorials and do it yourself. Email limit - i had a socialbookmarking plugin that was sending emails to ping.fm for distribution.\ni used the plugin at bluehost and at hostgator on various websites; the plugin exceeded the set email limit per hour per account. bluehost responds by suspending my entire account. over 35 websites down .\nhostgator responds by disabling cronjobs and informing me via email. the rest of the sites were still up and running.. (on this issue alone hostgator are more human/ understanding, bluehost i find them punitive implementing every letter on their TOS without warning / delay)\nBilling:\nif your account expires at midnight . it gets suspended same minute at bluehost.\nwith hostgator they allow upto 10 working days to sort your billing and just so you know during this period your services are up and running. with bluehost if you don't sort your billing your account is deleted Permanently after 10 business days. I had an incident where my credit card expired and the band delayed to renew it on time.\nbut i had tons of cash on paypal. but as you know you cant make a pre-approved payment with paypal even if you have a paypal balance. if your credit card is about to expire.\nthe only solution is to make a direct paypal transfer. so this happened to me when one of my bluehost account was about to expire. i requested that i send them paypal deposit to offset the renewal period.\nthey returned the money and said their system only works with paypal preapproved payments. so services will remain offline until i can sort the issue with getting a new creditcard. Those are the main issues i can recall.\nmy conclusion is. am staying with hostgator and i'll let the bluehost accounts expire naturally.\n\n                        \u00a0\n                    ", "picture_urls": []}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "4", "reviewed_at": null, "review_title": null, "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "Sneha Pasala", "absolute_url": "https://www.whoishostingthis.com/hosting-reviews/bluehost/page-5/", "website_name": ["Who Is Hosting This small logo"], "review_text": "\n            Blue host offers private servers and other great features.It is affordable and reliable.It offers many scripts like phbb,wordpress etc.Is consists of live chat and it offers support like 24/7(which is true)\nTheir services are awesome unlike many other hosting sites.

First, they are really accommodating with multiple add-on domain issues and cron problems, also issues with mod-security on linux apache installs.\nThey were helpful when I was first playing around and learning about how to set up add-on domains. Clearly when you have a lot of wordpress installs on the same shared hosting, it eats up your 'inode' limits that the host sets for your account (inodes being not the size of your files, but a system that the hosting company uses to basically limit your file usage ... by counting how many bits of 'data' you end up using).\nSo in my case I was playing around with various configurations like php.ini files and htaccess. Since I was still learning basic site administration, I was really learning through trial and error. Whenever I've run into issues and get stuck (lol always backup your data!), I usually get a quick response from them and they'll confirm with me if an issue was on their end or mine.\nAlso if I was able to change something vs. not change something on my shared hosting server. Basically if a newbie or intermediate site admin is looking for a reliable place to administer their own Html or wordpress sites, Bluehost definitely has great value in my experience and even now they continue to do so. \n\n                        \u00a0\n                    ", "picture_urls": []}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "5", "reviewed_at": null, "review_title": null, "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "Ginhinio Castelen", "absolute_url": "https://www.whoishostingthis.com/hosting-reviews/bluehost/page-6/", "website_name": ["Who Is Hosting This small logo"], "review_text": "\n            So I've been using BlueHost for a while now to host my personal website, And I'll say I'm pretty satisfied with their services the only problems I had were the fact that connecting to MySQL doesn't always seem to work can't figure out why yet.

However as we are a shared hosting environment with multiple accounts per server, it is impossible to provide a 100% uptime of our individual servers. Server spikes, poorly written code, malicious attacks and many, many other factors can affect performance on a server.\nAs services stop responding in a timely manner our admins investigate the server, to determine the cause, and when needed deactivate accounts that are abusing services, or causing them to fail. We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused you, however the only real way to provide 100% uptime for any web server is to host a domain on a redundant array of servers. We do not provide this type of service, and most providers charge several hundred dollars a month for such services.\nWith the low prices we charge, we are not able to offer redundant  servers.\"\nOK: so I understand now.

The Windows client supports the usual VPN protocols including OpenVPN which is great.\r\nWhat I dislike about expressvpn is that it loses connection fairly often and because the official Windows client doesn't have a kill-switch featurethis is a privacy risk. The Windows client does it's job well, but it does have some annoying bugs (easy fixable though).

OK, I'm going to try and press through. I have websites at GoDaddy no problem. OK, I can attach the name, but no way to know their exact nameserver is for the site.\r\nOK, now I have a front page on the reseller site. Can't change a thing. No FTP address to get new files up. This is a problem, right? So, I need to call support for this right? OK, listen to this.\r\nGoDaddy has a support number on their website, a single number. Now when you call that number it may or not be the number you need to talk to. I called the number and they had to send me to the reseller support dept.. OK, that was fine the day before. Yesterday, I called the same number, somebody picked up the phone and hung up. OK, maybe I made a mistake I'll try again. I call the number again and a Chinese sounding guy picks up the phone and says wrongs number. OK I am a fast learner calling this number is not going to get me anywhere. So, I search and find an email address.\r\nI email them and I write as precisely as I can, the problems and issues I have so that at least they would know what to address. I get an email back telling me I should call this number. No attempt to address the issues in the email. OK, this is the way it goes. So, I call the new number and it tells me the voice mail box has not been setup. WTF?\r\nLike I said I am a fast learned and now me and GoDaddy and the Reseller BS are done. Finished. I feel like a dope because I am thinking they are all top notch.\r\nWhy this is important, #1 if you enter the URL I attached to the site you get a blank space. Now there is a website, it is up and running, so what's the URL to get to it? Don't ask me I have no idea and I own it.\r\nI went through and jacked up the prices just for fun knowing most people not paying anything like that. Here is the thing, suppose some business buys up on a jacked-up price site and accessories, and then it craps out on them, and then they get support like I got. Who is going to get sued? Me, that's who, so I went back and globally reset all the prices, because I have zero control on anything dealing with that reseller site. I paid and have no idea how to administrate or operate it. I've already determined it is a loss, but I'm going to try and get refund, but I have no optimism on that.\r\nSo, if my story helps anybody contemplating being an entrepreneur with a GoDaddy reseller site, please, think twice. I wish I had known about this place before I signed up. I had no idea how decrepit this part of GoDaddy\u2019s service was, or I would never have given them my money.\r\nThe domain I attacher to this site is my business brand and it isn't working so I do not know the url of the site.

I have written them many times (never got an answer) and called their tech support many many times and my comments and suggestions seem to fall on deaf ears. If you have a site where you use very few photos and also change them infrequently, this might not be an issue. But if you DO like to have lots of images and switch them out frequently - STAY AWAY from these products!!!\r\n\r\nAfter this last time of trying to take off 20 photos and switch to new ones and it taking me almost an hour to delete the old photos, I have really had ENOUGH. With sites like Facebook allowing you to quickly upload, delete, switch around, move photos into albums and find them quickly - including photos that are actually text (pdfs) and SEE what they say - I do not and will not ever understand a web building service that does not allow these basic functions!! NO albums, so if you have say, 100+ photos, it is impossible to organize them.\r\n\r\nNot only that, but to find a photo that has been uploaded, say, to move it to another place on your site or delete it, scrolling down through the Photo Browser keeps popping the browser up to the top - MANY MANY times until you are finally able to scroll down far enough. Once you have scrolled down, then you can only access ONE photo. If you want another from the former photos, you can not choose more than one, so you have to repeat this whole scrolling thing, where the browser brings you back to the top many times, before you can finally access the photo that was maybe next to the one you just selected or moved. No batch selecting.\r\n\r\nYou also can not view the Browser photos in anything but a very small thumbnail. So if say, you have a number of pdfs with the same general format and that are in text, you are unable to differentiate one from the other. In my case, I have pedigrees of my cats that in thumbnail format all look the same. It is impossible to choose one, based on the text content. So I find myself uploading the same pdf images over and over again - simply because I can not SEE them, they are too small to read.\r\n\r\nThen again, you are unable to keep any images in folders, such as certain products or categories (T-shirts, cotton shirts or whatever have you).\r\n\r\nWorking with images within the Website Builder or Go Central is practically impossible and VERY VERY frustrating!! Even more frustrating is GoDaddy's complete disregard for listening to customers on these issues - and these services are EXPENSIVE!!! I'm sure I am not the only customer who deals with a lot of images on their site!! And if computers themselves can offer easy ways to find files and images and social media like Facebook can offer easy ways to organize, upload and delete files and images - WHY NOT GODADDY??? But they seem to not care and not want to listen.\r\n\r\nWell, they are going to lose a long time customer when my contracts are nearing their end this next time - I have three sites with them and I doubt I will renew..Less \n                                                        \n                        \n                                                \n                                                    \n                        \n                    ", "picture_urls": ["https://hostadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/GoDaddy.svg_-162x71.png"]}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "2.4", "reviewed_at": null, "review_title": "\n                        Terrible Service - Stay Away                                            ", "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "Carl M", "absolute_url": "https://hostadvice.com/hosting-company/godaddy-reviews/page/5/", "website_name": ["HostAdvice"], "review_text": "\n                        \n                                                                                        Go Daddy hosted web service and their \"Synching\" Feature is absolutely atrocious and unreliable.

Of course, technical support offered none of these ideas when I was within the 30 days and calling about the problems. Chris states while they do have situations where they give refunds outside of 30 days he will not give it here because that would be like trying to return a car because you don't know how to drive. So rude, condescending and unacceptable. I told him in good faith we had called and called and tech support offered nothing as to work arounds or even other ways to work that could have helped us. I stated again and again that the service did not work, the layout was faulty and it was not a straightforward user error in our case. After placing me on hold for 45 minutes because I felt they were being unfair as we were very close to the 30 days and they had a record that we had been calling in beforehand about the problem (he did check in a few times to see if I had anything new to add) he ended up hanging up on me.

I kind of debated with them for what's the logic in up-gradation if I get the same resource level. But the executive (girl) was quite dumb and could not justify and ended up saying that they have the same resource level setup for all the plans. Frankly speaking they charge almost the same amount as the hosting fee (one year) for resource level up-gradation which is not logical and feasible. The only benefit they show case is the number of emails they provide with each plans.

I was flooded with views for the 1st 10 to 14 days. Almost 500 of them. If I deleted any, they came back. Funny how the views and the notifications are not in sync with each other. I also get notifications of views, but they disappear when I click on them, and a different view profile shows up.\r\nFunny how there is no search function to view or contact a member by typing in a user name. That is a giveaway that the whole system is controlled. \r\nYou want me to spend another $10/month so that NON PAYING MEMBERS can read my messages? YOU ARE OUTTA YOUR @#$%&*@#$ MIND!!!!! Think about the logic here! Buy gifts? NOBODY CARES ABOUT THOSE!!!!\r\nMy contact wall is beyond crowded. More than half of them I've never made contact with. All it takes is a view and any response, or a maybe both ways on carousel to wind up there.\r\nThe \"Smart Pick\" is pretty stupid! Not even close to what I'm looking for. How can you be positive or negative with a micro thumbnail picture that is hard to see, and notice that no user name is given.\n\nNow for the positive. \r\nI have had some responses to messages, ranging from they are already dating someone to back and forth chats eventually resulting in phone conversations with real live women. Although I haven't met my match yet, I have 2 lady FRIENDS that I didn't have before, and whom I can call anytime. They are \"buddies\". No romantic inclinations, but we think alike and get along, and there is nothing wrong with having good friends. One is local, and one is not.\r\nThe Carousel matches have been mostly pretty accurate except for distance. Just how am I going to cultivate a relationship hundreds of miles away, although closer distances that are reasonable do show up. 50/50 on that one.\r\nI get many views from older women looking for a \"Boy Toy\". It seems that Zoosk generates quite a few views that really never took place, anywhere from 2 minutes to a few hours ago from launching the app, but not always showing in the notifications. More age appropriate women seem to be much less common.\n\nAll in all, credibility is an issue. Zoosk generates things to create an illusion of activity.\r\nYes there are real live good people there.

After I completed the whole subscription process, I was told that subscription price was 30$ (or something) PLUS a 25$ activation fee.  So a one-month subscription does not cost 30$, it costs 55$.  As I said, they lie.\n\nSecond, even at that price, you don't get access to all the site's functionalities.  For example, I noticed that lots of members could not contact me.  It's then that I realized that I had to pay an extra 10$ if I wanted to chat with all members...  And there are other functionalities for which you have to pay extra money.\n\nAlso, they have the ever very annoying policu of automatic membership renewal (without your explicit consent).  Be aware of that as well.\n\nSo, Zoosk works (it has worked for me), but they lie about prices.", "picture_urls": null}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "5.0", "reviewed_at": "21/08/2017", "review_title": "\u201cRiddled with scammers and fake profiles and more money grabs\u201d", "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "Chase\u00a0M.", "absolute_url": "https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/zoosk.com?page=11", "website_name": ["Sitejabber Online Business Reviews and Complaints"], "review_text": "The scammers post a photo with a telephone number and the words \"text me\" added with text in the image.

Men and Women who have departed from the Zoosk website (myself included) continue to have their profiles and photos displayed as if they were still members.  I viewed over 2,000 female profiles and responded to well over 200--I received less than 10 responses.  The most \"views\" and contacts I received were after I left the site--they do this to try and get you to renew your subscription.  They also use some random profile generator called \"carousel\" to send you candidates--however, YOU have no controls to the parameters they set and you get proposed matches that are from left field and totally unuseful!  This site is a terrible waste of time for someone who is serious about finding someone. They also use another technique of sending your candidate flowers, candy teddy bears or other icons--this is just stupid but people fall for it and pay the additional money.  This is the worst $29.99 that I have ever spent in my life!  Please DO NOT be foolish. One last measurement is that MANY Women and Men use photos that are 20 years old some even older, along with this many send pictures of pets or scenic views--Really don't care what your dog, cat or horse look like.

I was quickly matched with an extremely high amount of men, and I had just as many men interested in me and requesting to chat with me. I began chatting with several different men. The first man I became interested in lived 373 miles away. After chatting on Zoosk for a while, he asked to chat with me via phone. I provided him with my number. We chatted via phone/text and he soon invited me to visit him. He paid for me to come to see him and we had a great time and really connected. I thought he was a wonderful man. I stayed for 5 days and we set up another trip, this time to come and stay for 10 days. In the meantime, he became ill and was hospitalized. I still talked to him everyday and when things were bad, I communicated with his daughter. He was in the hospital and rehab a total of 3 weeks and my trip was coming up in a week. He was anxious to see me. I talked to him on a Wednesday, and didn't hear from him the next day or the following day. When I tried to contact him, his phone would ring, I would leave messages, send texts - no response. Finally - a 3-line text saying \"I'm sorry I've been so difficult lately. I really need to get my health straightened out. We'll see what happens at that point.\" That was it. I never heard from him again. He never officially \"broke up\" with me, he never officially cancelled the trip, etc. I was just left to wonder what happened. I did a little background searching on him and found out he had lied to me. He said he was married and divorced twice. He left out the third marriage and divorce I found on his county website. He also committed tax fraud on five years of his returns. The lawsuit against him was dropped when he filed Chapter 11 (Corporate reorganization) bankruptcy. I cautiously moved on to another man who was nice and a little bit closer (90 miles). Same scenario, chatted on Zoosk, moved on to talking/texting on phone. He asked to come to see me. We set up the date and time and talked the day before. He was to call me when he was on the road, but said the call should come around 12:30 p.m. That time came and went. At 1:30 p.m., I called him - two rings and it went to voicemail. He finally called me to say (in his fake shaky voice) that he was sick and had been trying to work up the courage to call and tell me he wasn't coming. In the meantime, I had spruced up my house, gone to the store to get some snacks, and got ready. Total time spent - approximately 4 hours. I told him that it wasn't a problem and we could reschedule some other time if he wanted. Still, the whole thing left a sour taste in my mouth since he had known the entire day that he wasn't going to come to see me and could have cancelled before I went to all the trouble of preparing for his visit. He contacted me the next day and asked to reschedule the date. We set it up for the next week, and every time I communicated with him thereafter, I asked if the date was still on, and every time he replied \"yes.\" The night before the date he sent me a text saying that he had looked at a couple of places to eat and said his plan was to be on the road by 2 p.m., to arrive at 3:30 p.m. He said he would call me before Noon. Noon came and went. At 12:10 p.m., I called him. Same thing happened as the previous time - phone went to voicemail after 2 rings. I texted him - no response. At 12:30 p.m., I called again - same thing. At 1 p.m. I sent him a text and said that it was over an hour past the time he said he was going to call and that if he was planning on being on the road in an hour, that I would think he would be up and about and would have long since contacted me. Finally, about 15 minutes later, I received a text from him saying, \"no matter what I say you are probably not going to believe me...\" He went on to say that his days and nights had been mixed up for a few days and that when I called him the first time he had only been asleep for 3 hours and there was no way he could drive down to see me on 3 hours of sleep. I asked him why he hadn't simply called me when he went to bed at 9 a.m. to say he was just going to sleep and would not be able to come down. He had no answer for me. Luckily, this time I had done no preparation, not even getting ready as my gut instinct was he was going to do this again. I went on to learn that although his profile said he was \"divorced,\" he was not actually \"divorced,\" rather \"separated.\" I told him that Zoosk had the option of putting \"separated\" as a status and asked why he didn't do that. He said it was because his divorce was going to be final \"soon,\" and that he had been \"separated\" for 7 years; also, because women would just go right past him if he put \"separated\" as his marital status. So - another man who lied! In every conversation that I had with him, this man referred to the woman he was married to as \"my wife.\" He never once referred to her as his \"ex,\" or \"soon to be ex,\" etc. It was why I questioned him about being married, and he told me he was \"separated.\" I don't believe for one minute that this man was in the process of a divorce. Someone who had been separated for 7 years would not continually talk about his wife using the term, \"my wife.\" I asked the man to never contact me again and blocked him on Zoosk and on my Facebook page. Unfortunately, I can't completely block him from my phone, but so far, he has not tried to contact me. I am now, again very cautiously, dating a man from Zoosk who only lives a few miles from me and has been a gentleman in every way. He is kind and gentle and I hold out some hope for this relationship. I went into such details about my first two experiences on Zoosk because I want to warn women to be very, very careful on this website. Even though we may feel safe with verified photos, phone numbers, email addresses and FB pages, these things definitely do NOT mean that a man is being honest. I wish that I could post the names of these men so that other women could be forewarned, but I know that is defamation of character, and so I can't do it. Hopefully my experiences will be enough that women will do a little background checking on the men they are going to date BEFORE they date them, rather than the way I did it - which was after the fact.

My advisce: 1) Those who treat online dating such as Zoosk as a recreation,  rather than a chance to be creative in \"selling your positives\" often feel depleted fast and lose the chance to meet really great people. 2) Physical beauty is only an introduction; allow your positives to make people want to share your presence. 3) You can date anonymously and still find happiness without hurting the other person.

I was in your exact place onCE time. I wondered to myself... How could a popular website like Zoosk yield such poor reviews online? Are people simply butt-hurt because they couldn't get a date?\r\n\r\nWhen you sign up for Zoosk, the platform seems friendly and promising. Your first red flag will appear when you realize you can't read messages from other users without paying for a subscription.... But you want to, oh so badly. \r\n\r\nSo you get suckered into that subscription, but before you even finish your purchase, Zoosk offers you more features for more money! And you're thinking to yourself... Well why am I paying for a monthly subscription if I don't even get all these other features included in there?\r\n\r\nThen comes the last slap in the face when you get to the final check out page, and realize that they have a $25 \"one time subscription fee\"... WTF is this? A gym membership? \r\n\r\nBut the greed doesn't stop there. Just about anything you want to do on this website costs more money. And you start to realize that it's likely that your matches are not even getting your messages, because they may not even have a Premium Subscription. So Zoosk is actually using your messages to honeypot other users into paying for a subscription, while you're left feeling demotivated because you are not getting a reply back from anyone. \r\n\r\nRight at this point, Zoosk delivers one last kick to the nuts. They automatically renew your monthly subscription without notifying you. What is the point of signing up for a one-month subscription vs a 12 month subscription if the former option gets automatically renewed without your knowledge. \r\n\r\nIf you're like me, you are finally so fed up by their scammer approach with online dating, that you decide to de-activate your account. At least you get to feel some joy when you click through their desperate click-bait attempts to keep you as a paying member. They beg and plead with you not to deactivate your account down to the very last click. \r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\nSearch for \"Zoosk reviews on Consumeraffairs.com and see for youself.", "picture_urls": null}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "4.0", "reviewed_at": "25/03/2017", "review_title": "\u201cWhat's wrong with the men on this site???\u201d", "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "Michelle\u00a0S.", "absolute_url": "https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/zoosk.com?page=20", "website_name": ["Sitejabber Online Business Reviews and Complaints"], "review_text": "I get plenty of views but what's wrong with these guys???

I am a widower.  I passed on her add twice, she answered my add.  I proposed at the end of our 1st date.  Never regretted it for 1 single second.  They do work.\r\n\r\nBut you will only get out of it what you put into your profile.  The more you put into your profile, the more careful you have to be.   The sites have one purpose, separate you from your money.  If you get a full subscription with all the frills, your experience will probably be a good one.  If you try to use a \"bargain\" subscription, everything is geared to get you to upgrade.  Be aware going in.\r\n\r\nI have proof on the mercenary methods of Zoosk.  Here is what just happened to me.  They will sell you \"coins\" which you can use to buy \"gifts, services, and upgrades\".  I had a balance in \"coins\" that would pay for \"read receipts\" (has a message been read or not).  You can use \"coins\" to buy a single \"read receipt\" for 35 \"coins\" or $14.95 in \"coins\" for the upgrade.  My first time on Zoosk, I had bought the $14.95 upgrade.  This was my 2nd time on Zoosk and I had not bought the upgrade.  According to the support tech, they were \"upgrading their services\" and because I had bought the upgrade my first time on Zoosk, I could use \"coins\" to buy anything else on the site EXCEPT the upgrade that I wanted.  The only way I could get a read receipt was to pay cash for the $14.95 upgrade.  It took me ten minutes of rephrasing the statement before the tech agreed that I was correct.  My number of stars just went from 3 to 1.  I expect to be treated fairly (yes I know that is a dream).  This type of treatment REALLY gets me angry.\r\n\r\nI have to be honest.  I have discovered that most of the original problems I had with Zoosk were because I did not update my e-mail forwarder when my IP host moved me to a new server so I did not receive the contact e-mails Zoosk did send me.  I have had others agree with me that if you try a bargain subscription,   then everything revolved around upgrading.  You have no positive way to know if someone you have tried to contact knows you exists (this was my fault).  The help is circular.  The \"support\" people restate the obvious.  After going around in circles, it became quite obvious that the entire site was designed to prevent contact and to force you to spend more money.  I must give them credit for policing their site.  I get far fewer \"ladies of the night\" and scammers than I did on Match.com.\r\n\r\nI would like to extend a strong caution to the women.  From the stories I hear, the scammers and men cheating on their wives is much worse for you.  BE CAREFUL.  There are good men out there (like me) but the people working the scams and hookers are extremely sophisticated and, I believe, are doing psychological profiling to target individuals.  I put a lot into my profile and it makes me an easy target.  I have had 2 hookers admit that they had been coached on how to approach me.  But if you are like me, this is the only way of meeting anyone, JUST BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL.", "picture_urls": null}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "0.0", "reviewed_at": "28/02/2017", "review_title": "\u201cLove it\u201d", "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "shantel\u00a0h.", "absolute_url": "https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/zoosk.com?page=22", "website_name": ["Sitejabber Online Business Reviews and Complaints"], "review_text": "Happy with the experience I received here on zoosk.

So, would anyone pay? without knowing who it is that sent it? It may be someone who is so NOT YOUR TYPE? It is such computer generated bull$#*!! Tonight I sent a wink to someone, and a message popped up on Face book that the person I winked at sent me a message...Sign up to read it. SO when I went onto Zoosk site to see who viewed me, that person had not even viewed my profile! SO, HOW COULD THEY HAVE SENT ME A MESSAGE WITHOUT EVEN VIEWING MY PROFILE????? It is SO EASY to figure out, it is~nt even funny! Maybe if it was REAL and you saw that they viewed your profile, and you could at least read their message! Than it would be up to you, if you were interested enough to pay to be able to respond! Was on this site many years ago as a payed customer, & the people they sent me as my matches were NOTHING that I would ever be interested in.And now keep my profile up unpaid just to prove it is a BIG SCAM! Just put up a profile, don`t pay, and watch how many people have an interest in you, just by checking out their profile. If I could market this site as an HONEST business note with out scamming you, you would only spend your money if you were REALLY interested in someone, and people on it, would for sure find who they are really looking for! Maybe I should start a REAL HONEST dating site! F**k computer generated bull$#*! to try to rip you off!!!!!!!!! Think you all get my point...,BTW,,, If they send you something that says, a Zoosk MEMBER is interested in you, it maybe someone who is hot.

This saves a lot of time wasted while waiting for a reply. They see your pic, say \"yes\" to meeting you, and then you can both look at the profile while you decide how to approach them, or IF you want to approach them. In my case, she had read my profile and contacted me. This eliminated the possibility that my first message went unread. She immediately replied and we had instant chemistry. The only reason I didn't give more stars is because you can't look at the profile before saying \"yes\" to \"meeting\" them online. You can't look at all their pics first either. The \"yes\" for both of you is based on one pic. It's not that the method is bad because it does what's intended. It gets you both talking to potential dates that are attractive to you. You can see the profile after you've both said \"yes,\" before your first message anyway, so the best thing about it is that it saves ALOT of sifting looking for someone that wants to talk to you. In this regard, Zoosk is the best dating site I've found for that, but DO read the profiles first or you're going to fail to 1) Capture their attention by noting something in common between you, compose an opening message that gets them talking about something in their profile, or have anything interesting to say. 2) They might not be in your area. In my case I was prepared to go anywhere to find compatibility. That's what they make planes for isn't it? I was lucky enough she was in my area.\r\nNo more bullet points!

Although I haven't gone out with any women, I have chatted with a few.  Nothing has led me to believe that any of them were bogus profiles.\r\n\r\nZoosk boats millions of members.  But the REAL problem is in the number of abandoned profiles.  I did a search within 50 miles of my location and Zoosk returned 269 different profiles.  Pretty darn good, eh??  NO!  Of those profiles, only 34 appeared to be active.  The rest?  Who knows, but they haven't been attended to nor ever deleted.  That means that nearly 87% of the profiles on Zoosk are a total waste of time as the users are long gone.\r\n\r\nA couple of examples:\r\n\r\nSome profiles start out saying \"I am 49 years old and.....\".  Yet, Zoosk states their age as 54.\r\n\r\nSome photographs have the digital date stamps on them.  Many I saw were 4-6 years old.  One profile I saw had photos with digital date stamps of 2004 and 2005!  So what you see is not what you'd be getting!\r\n\r\nAs a result, you'll need a shovel to dig your way through the deadwood.  Even at 34 seemingly active profiles, a small few may remain once you pass by the Angus-sized beheffers.  And good luck getting any of the good ones to reply.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nUpdate 9-1-16:  Another Thing I noticed.\r\n\r\nThe Zoozk \"Boost\" feature is an extra cost option which highlights your profile in several different fashions allowing you to receive many new views in a very short period of time (typically 1 hour).  However, you need to be online to activate (pay) it.  This would mark you as either \"Currently online\" or \"Recently Online\" in case you log off before your boost runs out.\r\n\r\nIt appears that if Zoosk isn't getting enough paying members to fill their boost, they just choose profiles at random.  Again, you are being directed to dead profiles.  Once you click onto a profile, it is not marked with either the \"Currently Online\" or \"Recently Online\" tags indicating the member never authorized or paid for the boost.", "picture_urls": null}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "5.0", "reviewed_at": "02/08/2016", "review_title": "\u201cHighly recommend it!\u201d", "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "LaKisha\u00a0D.", "absolute_url": "https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/zoosk.com?page=36", "website_name": ["Sitejabber Online Business Reviews and Complaints"], "review_text": "Zoosk is a perfect online dating site!

One woman I messaged, as a result,  said she had NEVER viewed me.  That indicates to me that there may be false \"views\".\r\n\r\nI sent several messages which went unanswered.  It appears that we are never told if the other party is a paid subscriber, so they can view our messages and chat with us, despite the fact we're prompted with \"Mary Jo is on line now!\" or \"Denise has sent you a chat request\".  \r\n\r\nOne woman I was conversing with (she seemed to good to be true), had a profile which had facts easily verifiable on Google, etc.  Nothing matched up.  She also said she'd gone to school at the Univ. of So. Cal. I used to work that neighborhood, so I asked her about her favorite eating spot, there.  Her angry reaction was way overboard which indicated to me she lied about going to USC or she was fake, altogether.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps it works well when BOTH parties are real.  It seems that Zoosk keeps encouraging us to spend just a little more $$$, every so often to improve our chances, yet the apple is always out of reach.  I guess it boils down to I'm not that clever of a guy, so as I'm unable to discern the real from the fake, I'm going to save my money from now on and look elsewhere.\r\n\r\nUPDATE (08/23/16):  I returned, after six weeks, to Zoosk.  It used to be you could apply \"coins\" (you amassed through the carousel game) to find out if the member you sent a message to had opened it.  Now, they want an additional (almost) $10 a month to tell you.  Just to see where things were I sent no less than 40 messages to local women, just saying hello and/or complimenting them on their profiles/photos.  I got, perhaps, two responses - indicating once again, that these profiles are either outdated (one woman had replaced her profile picture with a photo from her WEDDING), unavailable, or for non-existent people.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I had notifications that, \"Two women want to meet you.\"  It would cost 30 coins each to \"unlock the contact\", despite the fact these women had been easily accessible just in the days prior to this notification.  I hit the \"yes\" button and reached out to them both.  Four and five days without any feedback or contact, respectively, despite the fact I'd been told they wanted to communicate.\r\n\r\nFINAL UPDATE: With about 13 days to go, until my subscription expired, I went ahead and left.  I had NEVER heard from the two \"matches\" which I \"paid\" 30 coins each to make contact with.  I sent out almost 100 messages to see what kind of returns I'd get.  Less than 10% with only one local.  I had two more notices saying \"So-and-so is on line and wants to chat\"  I reached out to them both.  They both denied wanting to chat with me.  Perhaps they were chatting with others and \"wants to chat\" applies to that other party but not me, okay, then why tell me?\r\n\r\nPerhaps the bottom line is this...I'm not handsome, desirable, mature or clever.  Perhaps I am all those things.  More likely I'm somewhere in the middle.  I am tired of spending money, WHILE BEING ASKED FOR MORE, to get very little in the way of results.

You actually have to call India, or wherever else they have outsourced these jobs to, to find out, they do NOT allow you to state the status of your profile or subscription status.

Tire Kickers - ladies that are fielding the possiblities but not certain how they would fit it into their life. 4. professional dater - she'll meet for a few dates but the word GF never seems to apply. 5. Genuine Article\r\n\r\nRelationships are not easy. They require an investment on both parts just to see how it will work. You can't make that determination in a photo, a profile or winking.\r\n\r\nFor all of us, we can easily make a list of the pitfalls that have undermined past relationships. We must learn from the past and put it behind. Unless we are interested in something fast, easy or non committed, the profile needs to portray this. It should also portray a vend diagram that illustrates how much of a relation the person wants.\r\n\r\nI have found, after trying to chat with many women, successfully chatting with a handful, talking live with a fraction of those and finally meeting yet a fraction of that, only to find I was talking with someone who only wants to meet for an occassional date, a movie, dinner or drinks, or dancing. She won't use the word exclusive at any point because, she's playing the field. There is nothing wrong with that, except that it sets up a false reason to meet. This needs should be a clear goal in the ideal date. Because \"ideal date\" tends to suggest fairtale yet this person likely has a lineup of fairytales stacked. She'll have a tight schedule and will typically not be available during the obviously dating windows. \r\n\r\nKnowing this in advance is important. Knowing also where the person wants to go with the relationship. His/Her time line.

The only person I personally knew that tried online dating got married in 3 months, then divorced after a year. Not a good image.\r\n\r\nBut a friend convinced me to give it a try. What did I have to lose? Do I did. I started out with just a free account.   It turned out that free accounts could send messages but could not read messages. Major bummer.\r\n\r\nThat said, Zoosk does have a couple of cool features. First, you can send virtual \"gifts\" to other members as a way of showing interest or that maybe you liked their profile or pics. Second, you show your interests by categories (music. movies, television, people, etc.) Zoosk had a vast array of preset interests from which to choose.\r\n\r\nZoosk used this feature called Carousel in which they show you a pic of someone and their age. No profile or anything, just a pic. They ask \"Do you want to met him/her\". You must answer \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Maybe\". If you answer Yes or Maybe, you earn a coin. You can earn up to 40/day. After that you can buy coins for a somewhat hefty sum or just wait until the next day to earn more.\r\n\r\nThese coins are used to buy certain items, such as the previously mentioned gifts, and unlocking profiles you want to view on a matched user. \r\n\r\nThe problem with the coins is that paying members are required to use them too. If you don't have enough, you must purchase more. \r\n\r\nI feel that paying members should get a certain number of free coins and gifts per day. I also feel that no profiles should be locked to paying members. \r\n\r\nI also do not like that you cannot search on a username. If you happen top come across someone you like, you had better click the \"Add\" button so that you can find them later in your \"Connections\" otherwise you may have a very hard time finding them later.\r\n\r\nI did not get a paid subscription for a few months because I was \"Winking\" at people and sending messages left and right with no response.  \r\n\r\nFor some reason I finally decided I'd try a paid membership for 1 month. 10 days later it happened. I got a message from someone who had just joined that day.  It was HIM.  He found me.  I saw the message come up just as he first sent it. I viewed his profile and knew immediately he was the man for me. We exchanged email addresses and hit it off. We are madly in love like neither one of us ever dreamed possible.\r\n\r\nSo in the end, even with what I viewed as shortcomings, Zoosk worked!", "picture_urls": null}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "2.3", "reviewed_at": "04/03/2016", "review_title": "\u201cwhat a god damn rip off\u201d", "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "dean\u00a0l.", "absolute_url": "https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/zoosk.com?page=56", "website_name": ["Sitejabber Online Business Reviews and Complaints"], "review_text": "one thing i hate about these dating websites that you have to pay to message people its bloody disgusting that you have to pay to message someone but it doesn't they are going to reply back to you and they don't tell you until you try to send a message to a girl you like", "picture_urls": null}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "2.6", "reviewed_at": "02/03/2016", "review_title": "\u201cWasted time on unreal profiles.\u201d", "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "Jason\u00a0M.", "absolute_url": "https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/zoosk.com?page=56", "website_name": ["Sitejabber Online Business Reviews and Complaints"], "review_text": "Winks suck.

And let's be honest, if you are truly looking for a partner or life's mate then you want to COMMUNICATE any time you are free. This can be a minute or for hours getting to know someone. That doesn't happen with the CHAT texting. It is very time consuming and wasting of much effort when you don't hear back for days or weeks and the feeling is lost. \r\nI solved the problem after a few weeks of this. I sent out a text and told the person after finding a profile and photos that I really was interested in that I hated the CHAT method and that I was truly interested in her. I then wrote a long chat and gave a clear highly honorable description of the true inner caring and loving person that I am. I was inviting and offered an unforgettable pleasure and excitement that she would enjoy if she were willing to just read my profile and give herself a true chance to converse and share a moment. I told her I trusted her based on her profile of truth and gave her my cell phone.\r\nWhy? Because she was beautiful, educated, and I felt the need of caring in her profile. I knew from her photos that she would get literally hundreds of chats every week. She was a high demand gorgeous woman physically and smart. My profile was complete and the truth in each major phase of life who I was. It was well done, enticing, inviting and very promising to any woman wanting that man to be there star. The good about me far out-weighed the misfortunes and dislikes of my person. Humbly written, this was a catch for her and I let her know I felt the chemistry was there if her profile was true. \r\nShe called me at 2;30AM a few days later after her long shift. It took her two times to read and absorb all I had written. But, when half-done, she was tired from work and just took the one opportunity I offered. I was not interested in the stupid CHAT game. I truly wanted to know the heart and soul of this beauty. \r\nWhen she called she was tired and happy. She wanted to call back next day. I said I am available ANYTIME. She was so happy. The next day, it was a 2-3hr call. We met two days later on her off day for wonderful evening of dinner and 1 wine.We had 1 1/2 hr wait at a Bistro dinner and I planned special treat for her tired soul, who had worked a double shift. I paid for a massage for her weary body and a separate one for me. She was so happy that I cared for her health. The masseuse thought we were married and asked if we wanted it done together. I was humbled and embarrassed. I hadn't considered that on 1st date. She looked at me so grateful and happy and told him, we want it together. I knew there and then that she trusted me and our chemistry was there immediately. She told me, please turn your head when we stripped down. I laughed and said, \"Of course not\", and laughed and said, \"But I might peek you're so beautiful, no I'm just kidding\". She laughed even more when I said \"I peeked, NO just kidding.\" She said, \"she did peek when I turned around\".\r\nThe embarrassment was gone, we wanted each other from that moment.\r\nI took her home early 10pm and let her get much needed rest after a fantastic and wonderful dinner time. She was on vacation for 10days just two days later with no big plans except to rest. I took her to my home next day, and we spent those 10 days together just listening to each other and sharing our hardships and happiness of just seeing each other. We did much more as you know. I let her know from the first sad story she told me that I repeated in my profile, I have one responsibility and that is \"to make your life better\". She saw that from the first date of massage when she was so exhausted, yet wanted to keep the date and her word of integrity after working two shifts 18hrs. I was unbelievably honored by this woman. How could I not think of how she gave of herself to start.\r\nBy the way, I am 66 and she is 48. Not your average woman, but a stunning beauty in every way. She looks about 32-33. Her zoosk has hundreds of chats weekly. She says I look about 50, well built athlete all my life. But the one thing that both humbly shared is the need to be cared for and care for the other person. That is the building block from the heart when one can listen to another's meaning behind the words, and not just the words making conversation.\r\nWe are together now as lifetime mates. We just enjoy being together and give in to each other whenever needed. Its all about loving and caring to hear and feel each others thoughts.\r\nMOST IMPORTANTLY,  GIVING MEANS LISTENING AND RESPONDING IN A CARING WAY THAT HELPS THE OTHER PERSONS LIFE BECOME BETTER WHETHER IS THE MANY THOUSANDS OF SMALL THINGS OR THE FEW GREAT LARGE THINGS. ALL ARE IMPORTANT WHEN YOU TRULY CARE OR LOVE SOMEONE.\n\nI let her know that my positive feelings are to make her life better from the heart and every other way possible. She worked late alternating hours. I told her call me ANYTIME because others did not and that ruined the start of communication with nearly all of the men.

Unfortunately for me, I didn't do enough checking before I signed up. By the time I realized that all these pictures and profiles couldn't possibly be real, it was too late, as it could be for you if you're not following this. These are scam artists, and have a nice day trying to unload them once they get your credit card information. Take a good look at their terms of service and make sure your not standing on a bridge, because you'll want to jump off. They tell you directly that they use what is referred to as 3rd party representatives, which means that you're going to have idiots from the site contacting you and pretending to be the people you think you see in the profile pictures. Most of the pictures and profiles are photo shopped or stolen from Facebook or porn websites. Read all of their terms and conditions and then look down to see if your shoes are tied together, because that's what you'll feel like. They'll auto-upgrade you from a trial membership to a full, paid one, and then start charging your credit card for more scam sites. They were charging me for 3 different sites before I could stop them. Ultimately, I had to cancel my credit card and close my checking account to get rid of them. This site is no different when you register. Seconds after my information was sent, my email inbox was ready to fly. Dozens of women had viewed me! Too bad I hadn't given them a picture of myself yet or any profile info. Women contacting me from towns with the names spelled wrong. Who can't spell the name of their town?  One was emailng me from a town that was destroyed by a coal mine fire in the 1980s! Some of the profile pictures make no sense. One supposedly from California, had the Eiffel tower in the picture. Another, reportedly one of my \"local neighbors\", had Yosemite Park in the background. Others are of dogs or animated characters.  What kind of dopes do they think people are? What does it matter because all they want is to roll you for money. Notice the addresses of these clowns. Nigeria, Antigua, Malta, South Africa, Cyprus, Antilles, and they're going to try and match you up with someone from your own town? Good luck with that and guess where your credit card information is going when you register.  Don't expect their customer service to be much help or even in your language, either.

I signed up because I read that it was the #1 dating app. I signed up for free and started getting messages right away (imagine that). However you can't read any messages unless you pay. I signed up so I could see these messages and decided on a 6 month membership because it was discounted and I figured it would take a little while to meet the a good match. Big mistake.\r\n\r\nThe so-called messages that I received were actually just \"winks\" and it is not clear if they were from actual people or just an automatic thing the site does to try to get people to sign up. The site seems to be more about chatting with people and the profiles usually have very little info. \r\n\r\nI tried to figure out how to cancel but it was really hard to find any contact info. When I contacted them and they told me I had a 3 day window to cancel since I live in California. There was still 1 day left and I cancelled immediately. However I did not receive a refund. Apparently all this did was make sure that my membership did not renew automatically.\r\n\r\nSince I had already paid I continued to check in on the site to see if I could make the most of it. Wow, what a total waste of time. In 6 months time and a significant effort I did not wind up meeting one person and it was difficult to even get someone to chat with me. There was one woman that did want to meet but she was frustrated with the site so she quit. She sent me her number before she quit but I did not write it down immediately and once her profile was gone so was the message with her number.\r\n\r\nMy membership expired recently and I checked back to see some of the messages that I had received but all the communication that I had over that time was blocked. I could see the messages that I wrote but all of the responses were blocked. How bogus is that?\r\n\r\nI am on 2 other sites that do not require you to pay to contact other users. In the same time I have met several women from those sites. The information that people provide in their profiles on those other sites gives you a much better idea if you are a good match. One of the sites even matches you up based on a quiz that you fill out. \r\n\r\nBottom line, I would not recommend this site to anyone.

This was a couple of days ago and I have had only two views since and no email or other contact from anyone! lol! \r\n\r\nThe other strange thing was that when I joined as a free member (and I have to admit I was a tad cynical about this at the time) there was a very high proportion of profiles with pictures of professional quality depicting stunning women. I'm sure some of these were genuine :) However I have never seen this ratio of \"supermodels\" to normal mere mortals before.\r\n\r\nFinally this happens in life I know. But it seems to happen on some sites more regularly and this site is one of them for me. Namely arranging to meet someone who continually tries to rearrange on you. \r\n\r\nI've been on sites where this hasn't happened in years of membership. I've been on sites where it happens almost as soon as you join and strangely seems to happen most frequently at the end of the month when your fee is due. someone pops up out of the blue and wants to meet you! Co-incidence maybe?\r\n\r\nI sure wouldn't recommend this site, although I expect it works well for some.", "picture_urls": null}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "1.0", "reviewed_at": "09/01/2016", "review_title": "\u201cDon't waste your time or money\u201d", "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "David\u00a0O.", "absolute_url": "https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/zoosk.com?page=62", "website_name": ["Sitejabber Online Business Reviews and Complaints"], "review_text": "Most of the profiles you see will not be active or respond.

I will push this all over the internet and i will not stop until i see that zoosk runs out of business and if you take this for a job and don't refund or reactivate my account, then you will see how serious i will get with making sure you run out of business.\r\n\r\nAm giving you guy 1 hour to refund me back my money or virtually all sites i surf on the internet will carry the news of how fraudulent your dating site is.\r\n\r\n1 hour and thats it.\r\nIf you think this is a joke, then please do me the favour of not refunding me back my money in just 1 hour and we will see what happens.

The second one is where they legalise the scam - 'we've got you're money and there's nothing you can do about it.' OK, I've been scammed for \u00a325 ($40), big deal, I'll get over it and learn my lesson. As for zoosk?

One thing lead to another and on September 4 2015 after knowing each other for only a few days we married in Coeur D Alene Idaho. . All praises go to the lord.

It would also be nice to configure preferances such as distance and age range so one will not be bothered by the winks, message or even views of anyone outside of those preferances.  As I would check the new views, each pass over someone I had viewed before counts in the system as having 'viewed' their profile even though we are just clicking through the views see what the 'new' ones are.  This is misleading, causing others to think you are constantly 'checking them out' when you're really not.

Then I learned that I have to pay again for access to the men who pop up and show an interest in me.  \r\n\r\nTo pay for what I thought I had already paid for, you need Coins.  To get Coins, there is something called Carousel where you earn Coins by indicating YES, MAYBE, or NO when a random man's face pops up.  Just his face.  No profile info whatsoever.  You can't read anything at all about him in order to make an informed choice.  You can't get a Coin for a NO answer.  You can only get Coins - which you will then use to buy access to the truly interesting man who is trying to reach you - by clicking YES or MAYBE.  \r\n\r\nOf course, to be fair, if you want to spend even more on this absurd site, you do have another option.  You can outright pay cash for Coins.  \r\n\r\nSo to whore your way to a bigger cache of Coins, you choose MAYBE for  the 30 guys who look most like the man of your dreams and least like the man of your nightmares (30 is  the minimum needed to pay to play as far as I can tell). You choose MAYBE even if the man in the picture looks like Dog the Bounty Hunter and you are hopinng for Atticus Finch.  \r\n\r\nThen later, when some of the MAYBEs contact you, and you finally get to read about them, you  learn enough about them to smile, grimace, or scream.\r\n\r\nSupposedly you can Chat with someone who is on line at the same time you are.  But all that amounts to is sending him a message which he will see right away because he is on the site at the moment.  This is not like a Live Chat with AT&T.

I had tried it some time back and it wasn't very good.  Sadly it is no better and is possibly worse.\r\n\r\nI registered yesterday.  All looked well, easy to use interface and some pretty ladies.  I found a lady local to me that seemed nice so thought I would send a message.  I couldn't however do this as I would need to pay the subscription.  Ok that's fair enough, you can't expect everything for free.  I instead sent a wink and pressed the \"added\" button which I took to mean she would be added to a favourites list.\r\n\r\nA few things happened next.  First I almost immediately (a matter of minutes) got a message from her, or at least a notification that she had sent a message (I couldnt read it without a subscription though).  Great I thought, this is a really great site, I never got that sort of success elsewhere.  I carried on looking through those on the website and sent another wink to another girl.  The same thing happened.  I started to smell a rat by this point.\r\n\r\nLater I noticed that the \"added\" button I had pressed had been recorded as me sending her a \"chat request.\"  That wasn't what I had intended to do so already I am sending out inaccurate messages through the misleading button \"added.\"\r\n\r\nI was suspicious that the first girl I had supposedly had a message from was real so I decided to try and google her using her photo.  I did actually find her LinkedIn page and managed to send her an email to her work address.  I wouldn't normally do this as girls tend to freak out at this sort of thing, but I felt I had a legitimate reason to email her; I wanted to know if I was about to be scammed by Zoosk.  The next day (today) I got a reply from her work address and she told me (thankfully politely) that she had not sent me a message and had in fact not been on the site in over a year.\r\n\r\nTonight I tried using the \"added\" button again on another girl and as before I had a \"message\" from that person.  However looking at the notification on one browser it said the girl had \"sent me a chat\" and another browser she had \"sent me a message.\"\r\n\r\nI am regularly getting all sorts of notifications from various people now which is way more interest that I got on POF.  I have read a great number of bad reviews about Zoosk and how it is a scam site.  I take them with a pinch of salt as some people expect to use a website and it to be totally free.  This is stupid, you can't expect a company to create a service and let you use it for nothing!  You will also find a number of disgruntled single guys who have a chip on their shoulder about online dating.\r\n\r\nThat aside, Zoosk does seem to be a dubious website from my short experience and I wouldn't trust it based on that experience and on the dozens of scathing reviews about the website.\r\n\r\nMy advice is be critical, careful and suspicious.

I hope U have taken my advise so far and also HAVE BEEN READING REVIEWS ON THE INTERNET AND LISTENING TO SOME VERY GOOD AND INFORMATORY ONES ON YOU TUBE before subscribing to any SEX, DATING, OR SINGLES SITES.  READ FIRST!!  They are from considerate people, probably just like me who just want to protect your WALLETS or for some, PURSES.    \r\nWell, I did it again Guys!!  I am your \"Guinea Pig\" for another SITE.  This time it is listed as the #1 SITE.  Taking my own advice, Ihad only signed up for a month around July 5th. I quickly noticed all the Women on there from all races, types, and from all over the U.S.. Like always, I had text a few of my desired type, then just alittle while in, I started to notice I had text around 40. I had to immediatly stop. I said, what happens Cisco if more than enough answers and U like them all??  Since I am a Gentleman and really am not searching to hurt any feelings of the interested Females, I did stop and started to view all that had viewed me and was quickly going to message the ones I wanted to really correspond with. It sees that I had I had earlier sent messages to most, so, still being interestd in them, I sent another message. As I've said to U before;  \"guess what\"??  Most of them had \"viewed\" me again, then again, and again.  \"WTF\", I SAID!!  Why are they all just \"viewing\" me when I was really expecting a \"message\" by now!!  After I called the # for the site TWICE & through all the explaining and being credited a total of 300 coins, (which is optional for U to buy, but not necessary, and for me didn't see a need for) I went back and used the \"coins\" as suggested by those 2 phone calls on \"boosting my profile\".  Again, \"WTF\"!!  Man!!  I was getting noticed more and more and still more!! Almost 100!!  BUT, HOLD IT!!  THEY WERE STILL F~~K~N JUST \"VIEWING\" ME, AND NOT EVEN '1' MESSAGE  AS A RESPONSE!!  The site had told me that some of the Women didn't make the required payment to be able to text or message back. Now, Guys, (lol) after all the sites I have been on, I have never heard of this or even had a problem with an interested Woman sending a response to my initial message, and not only that!!  Remember Guys, I had an initial 40 total messages sent, AND U MEAN TO TELL ME ALL 40 OF THEM THOUGHT TO COME TO THIS SITE AND KNOWINGLY NOT HAVING PAID TO BE ABLE TO RESPONDWITH A MESSAGE ARE ALL JUST GOING TO \"VIEW\" US GUYS AND NOT DO ANYTHING TO LET US KNOW THAT THEY LIKE US OR SAY HELLO TO NOTHING AT ALL??  AND HERE  I AM, REMEMBER, PAID IN FULL AND TEXTING MY ASS OFF AND STILL NOT RECIEVING ANY RESPONSES FROM THEM??  \"WTF\" IS GOING ON HERE??  Why would a non paying Woman even go to the site in the first place??  I'd love to see what would happen if she really saw a Guy she really liked and could not do a dam thing about it??  As for me at this point fellas, I had just e-mailed Zoosk right before texting this review to U.  It was said that some Assistant will send a response to me in 2-3 days!!  I am as of now letting my \"MONTH\" subscription run out while waiting.  Also in the meantime, I SENT A LAST TEXT TO \"EACH INTERESTED WOMAN\" THAT HAD \"VIEWED\" ME IN ALOT OF TIMES,  THAT IF THEY WERE NOT GOING TO AT LEAST MESSAGE ME WITH A RESPONSE, THEN I HAD WANTED NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH THEM.

They did this twice ! So, censorship is alive and well at Zoosk even though it did NOT violate their terms f agreement.\r\n\r\n2. They have the \"Carousel\" which is a series of pictures of potential partners. You either say you are interested or not. Problem is all they will show you is the picture. No location, nothing that would indicate they would be a match for you. You have to get \"tokens\" to do this. Then once you say you want to meet that person it costs you 30 tokens to actually see their profile. I can honestly ell you that 99% of the people they sent me lived at least 75 miles away.\r\n\r\n3. When I complained to Zoosk about censoring my profile, they cancelled my subscription ! They said I could still access my account for \"free\" although all I could do is see that people sent me messages. I could not rad anything or respond. Despite cancelling my membership when I looked at my account, they billed me for renewal for another month. When I wrote them complaining about charging me for a service they weren't providing me, they ignored my letter.\r\n\r\nSo, there are far better places to do business than Zoosk.

Well, I typed on my profile that \"if you are seeing this profile after this date that it is fake\".  They keep removing my comment.  Go figure!!!  So I figure there are more fake profiles there.  I will not renew.  Before I cancelled my membership, I deleted my picture which I am glad I did.\r\n\r\nWhen you delete you account, you must go back in and \"deactivate\" your account.

I realize this causes hard feelings to the shorter guys when women seem to overlook them for taller men. The thing that is unfortunate until you realize that Zoosk is pushing the shorter guys on the carousel, you may indicate you want to meet an individual based on a face photo. There is no way that I know of to look at a profile prior to deciding whether to like someone or not from the carousel. Once these guys see they have someone interested, they jump right on it expecting to get a warm reception. Once their profile is visible and it's obvious the guy is 5'3, or 5'6...the deal is off. They wonder why we act interested, then go silent, this is why, a lot of women aren't interested in short men. Zoosk is setting up these guys for disappointment by not allowing at least their height to be shown. Men say it's shallow or mean for a woman not to give short guys a chance. If I weighted 300 lbs or was butt ugly but had a way to keep it from being known prior to having the guy choose whether to like me...this would be an entirely different story after they could see the truth...I would get ignored or worse, called nasty names.

First, I don't understand people that complain about spending a little money to potentially meet someone and yet they won't hesitate dropping $5 or $6 on a coffee drink.  I spent $56.21 for a six month membership in Oct 2014.  I actually called Customer Service to ask a question and he/she offered to drop the activation/registration fee ($25, I think), if I joined right then ... so I gave it a try.\r\n\r\n2.  I knew I was in trouble from the very beginning when some Zoosk censor edited my profile.  I can understand removing email addresses, phone numbers, profanity, etc.  But all I put was \"please be patient with me, I don't log on very often.\"  They removed the \"I don't log on very often\", so it was \"please be patient with me\" which makes it sound like I'm a little \"slow\".\r\n\r\n3.  One of my pics was a chest shot (no frontal nudity) and they removed the pic, could never figure out why.\r\n\r\n4.  Like so many other reviews have stated, the Zoosk Coins thing is very annoying.  It feels like you are being nickel and dimed, even after you have PAID for membership.\r\n\r\n5a.  The Carousel feature is very strange.  You are asked if you are interested in someone based solely on their age and picture (pretty shallow if you are looking for something more meaningful).  I thought it was a tool to learn more about your tastes, so the site could make more educated matches.  I didn't know it was actually sending messages to the people I answered yes.\r\n\r\n5b.  Now the people that show up in this Carousel feature are no where in your immediate geographic area.  So you could be responding yes to people in neighboring states.  I live in Las Vegas and got messages from California, Utah, Arizona ... most of the Western US.  I don't think those other guys realized I was far away as well.\r\n\r\n6.  The chat feature is dumb.  How hard is it to create a straightforward program to exchange messages back and forth?  But somehow Zoosk managed to screw that up as well.\r\n\r\n7.  There's a SmartPic feature where Zoosk picks a potential meetup, you have 24 hours to reply.  In the whole six months, I replied to approx. 20 but never heard back from one.\r\n\r\n8.  Like other reviews have stated, you do get lots of messages from other people but when you reply, you never hear back from them.  Which makes you think the original message was a fake message generated by Zoosk.\r\n\r\n9.  I should have read the Sitejabber reviews on Zoosk before I joined.

So i did, all 3 messages from the good looking profiles asked where my profile picture was. I was still setting up profile and loaded it. \r\nNow the good looking profiles (bear in mind i am a 41yr old female who has been on dating sites previously) never once entered my profile again as Zoosk records this. Okay so i may not be their standard but why would good looking profiles start emailing all new joiners asking for their profile pictures, they do not need too.\r\n\r\nI studied these profiles, there were 3 in total and they were very similar as all the men has their photos verified, had received stacks of gifts (promoting new users to buy gifts) whereas when you compare to the average normal user, no one in their 40's has been sent gifts as it is childish and they are online for almost for 24 hours a day.\r\n\r\nI do not doubt there are regular users as the numbers are huge on this site, i just want to warn others that you could be drawn into subscribing under false pretenses. I am not bitter that i have not met someone as there are plenty of sites to join i just wanted to give my honest opinion on this site. I feel pretty strongly about this that i will email Trading Standards to ask for an investigation on their practice.\r\n\r\nI also object to the fact that i cannot remove my profile from the site until my subscription month ends. I should be allowed to take down my profile at any stage in my subscription. Instead i have removed everything from my profile until i can take down.\r\n\r\nI also want to add i have had approx 20 messages from regular users all saying a version of 'make my day, make my year by just emailing to say hi'. i assume the site suggests this sentence as i have had so many similar ones now.\r\n\r\nThis site is not like any others i have joined, where people do write proper emails, with questions and comments about your profile so you at least can communicate.\r\n\r\nThis maybe right for some people but i just wanted people to be aware before they join, what they are actually receiving for their money.", "picture_urls": null}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "5.0", "reviewed_at": "13/05/2015", "review_title": "\u201cI met someone compatible so fast\u201d", "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "Angy\u00a0s.", "absolute_url": "https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/zoosk.com?page=85", "website_name": ["Sitejabber Online Business Reviews and Complaints"], "review_text": "I met someone who I am extremely naturally compatible with.

Yes I had the same experience detailed by other people in these comments.  After choosing the six month price I clicked in my credit card number and advanced to the next page where I was informed there was an additional fee of $25, \"activation fee\" ...nice one Zoosk.  Of course there is no \"back\" button, or \"cancel\" button so you don't know if you are going to be charged if you disagree to their tacky, tacky way of roping their customers into paying a charge that was NOT explained beforehand.  Is that legal? The next day I received an email from Zoosk saying they would waive the activation fee if I registered and paid within 24 hours.  If you do sign up, I recommend you do what I did (begin to register and then exit the page) and then register the next day to avoid the BS fee.  The deal is, I don't mind if there is a fee but it is ethically wrong for Zoosk to keep it hidden until after your credit card number has been entered.  As consumers, are we going to put up with this crap?  Businesses that do this are slime and as consumers we should not stand for it.\r\n\r\nA week or so later I said to myself, \"OK dude get over your hissy-fit and just join.  If it's a good service don't let your bad attitude about their ethics get in the way.\"  So I did join and have been a member for almost six months.  I have not received a message back from anyone I have tried to contact.  That's OK.  Maybe the people who are not members don't get the messages delivered to them.  I don't know how Zoosk works.  I'm not upset about that so much, but what bugs me is that they ask you to pay more to see if the person you contacted actually read the message.  Or they want you to pay more to send it quickergeeI guess I shouldn't assume that once I've paid to be a member that I'd have full use of the service.  No, they nickel and dime you for more.  Very understandable in our business-before-ethics culture.  \r\n\r\nAlso you can boost your \"popularity\" by allowing Zoosk to validate your phone number or photo but to do that they want to phish into your Facebook data.  Maybe that's not such a bad thing but it's a turn off.  Do they mean I'll be more popular, sexy or desirable if I share my Facebook data and friends list with them?  \r\n\r\nOh.I almost forgot, Zoosk automatically puts it's members in \"automatic renewal\" status.  You get what that means, right? Zoosk automatically renews and charges your credit card when your subscription runs out.  Lots of web based businesses do this.  Zoosk does not give it's customers the option to approve or disapprove \"automatic renewal.\"  A business operating in good faith sends it's customers a message asking the customer to approve payment for renewal.  Not Zoosk, as well as plenty of other businesses these days.  Building customer \"good will\" means nothing to them. They figure, \"well, if our customers forget to renew, we'll just charge them for the next pay durationheh, heh.\"  In order to quit, you have to go into your settings and \"unsubscribe\" before your subscription duration is over.\r\n\r\nAs to the actual functioning of the Zoosk website, I have really no idea.  I didn't get a date or even make contact with anyone in the five and a half months I've been a member.  So maybe it works fine, I don't really know.  I'm not going to say the site doesn't work, but I will say strongly that for me Zoosk's business ethics are a real turn off to anyone who gives a damn about how they are treated.

To subtly approach women, men can send a gift.  However these \"gifts\" are  purchased by first spending real money to get a virtual currency \"coins\".  Once a member has purchased coins, they can now spend them to purchase girts or unlock a connection.  Basically, to really access the full experience of Zoosk, in a better user friendly way, you need coins and lots and lots of them.  In short it's a scam for Zoosk to earn more money off innocent people after the subscription.  The subscription allows for you to have a conversation with other members, while 30 coins allow you to actually begin MOST conversations.   There is a way to acquire coins for free, and that is to spend ridiculous amounts of time constantly viewing pics and profiles, just to get one coin for Liking someone.  Again, it seems that almost 1/3 to 1/2 seem fake members.  \r\nThe good news, in spite of all the crap, there were some actual real people (hurray) who I connected with.

Only problem is that you can't contact any of these singles unless you pay. They continually wet your appetite  by sending your photos of people who allegedly want to meet you until you succumb.

That they're isnt really a trial to try it out. You can't actually test it out to find out if you like it or not. You cant message anyone, try any of the features. Nothing.... absolutely nothing unless you pay for the site. This is not a good marketing skill. I'm very disappointed in Zoosk all together. It's very unprofessional to such advertisement and make it sound great and then rip the welcone matt as soon as the application is downloaded. Can i afford to pay for it; yes. Absolutely, but I'm not likely to subscribe if they're isn't even a way for me to find out wheither i like it first or not. For me to pay for it and then find that it isn't something I'm interested in and then disputing the situation with your company would be a waste of time and energy on the the customers part. You should advertise that Zoosk is not a free site. That you do have to have a membership in order to do anything on the application or else it is useless. Honestly i believe that the google play store should enforce situations like this so that the customer has to pay up front in order to even download your application. At that point then you will find out how many downloads you won't recieve, and for the ones that do... you will just have another dirty way to dig into that persons pocket and win some more free money towards your company. From there you might actually be willing to hire someone who is not lacking the professionalism it takes to say what you doing is completely redundant and just plain out stupid. What you are really doing is just getting your ratings up by letting people download the application and then it show that number on the view of it on the play store. Not how many of those downloads are actually using your site. Not impressed at all. I find it very irritating and it pisses me off that your company is framed and structured this way. Someone on that end is not very intelligent. . So since you wasted my time once more asking me for my review which you honestly couldn't give a damn about... other than letting me download this application and then trying to use it. I'll do you one more. I'm going to coppy and paste this E-mail. Post it to google review, Facebook, Twitter, anyplace that has zoosk attached and let people know that this is not the way to get they're attention and they shouldnt download it.

Hopefully this will help you determine if you should join. First of all is not a bad website, is clean, easy to use and simple., However when I was checking it out I noticed on some of the likes I went through I would get an instant reply with a message. Excited enough I joined thinking it was an actual message lol Anyways I decided to give it a try to find out it was only an automatic reply some members have set whenever you wink at them. For me it is a big turn down because I would expect an actual answer or a simple silent. I just feel this is deceiving in a way to recruit members. Also be aware there are scams and fake profiles that would send you messages. My personal experience and don't take my word for it. There could be profiles made only to recruit. Another thing you should know the website is very bold about making you spend as much as they can. They have features like coins that are very expensive just for sending gifts that are only icons. Overall just be aware that is not as simple as it looks and is really expensive in my opinion. However if you don't care for expensives & simply want to find a date. Is not a bad website. This is only based on my experience & we all have different luck.

Of course there was a terrible accident getting off the plane in Dubai and he needed a new cell phone and laptop and could I send him one so he could get home; he needed all his contacts.  He assured me that when he got back to the States we would finally meet and then he would reimburse me by expenses. REALLY!  When I refused to send him anything he got angry and tried to blame me for not 'being there' for him when he needed me the most.  His call came from an exchange that is common in Ghana.

After 6 months, I was unable to generate even one date from this site which is a stark contrast to other sites, where I was able to connect and meet several in person within the first month of use.  POF and OKQupid perform and function better than Zoosk even though they are free.  Zoosk also employs manipulative practices to make you believe it is going to do something for you.  There is this goofy popularity meter that reads high the day you sign up and high again when your cancelled subscription is about to run out but low the rest of the time even though the volume of interface is consistent the whole time.  It is loaded with fake profiles (which are easy to spot if know what to look for), and you get inundated with want to meet requests from the most hideous looking, unkempt or obese individuals, most are many years older than you, and with a profile write-up that tells the story of a complete loser (many are too lazy to even put some effort into describing what they are like and what they are looking for).  The messaging feature is strange. It is a single line text box where you can only see a portion of the current sentence you are writing,  It appears to be designed for those who like to text in half sentence bursts and live through their smart phone.  There is a \"wants to meet\" feature, but you have to decide only on their profile picture and very little more.  If you both click someone has to pay to unlock the match to look at the others profile or communicate.  I believe some of these are generated by the Zoosk site and not the one indicated.  They also have this stupid gift feature that you pay to send images of flower, wine, etc.  If you do choose to use this site, only use the message feature, as this is the only one I noted generated any response back. The other \"make a connection tools\" to show interest seemed to simply fall into a black hole.  There does appear to be some quality individuals that use the site, who might be \"keepers\", but they are far and few between.

I weeded out the guys I found no connection with and kept the ones I did. Simple right? We met at a public place and went from there. I'm happy with the results.

The Search tab is better than POF I must say. In this section you can select what you are looking for as far as age, ethnicity, children, education, body type, etc. and Zoosk actually does a good job of properly filtering your search. (Why you can't filter the Online Now tab is a mystery to me) But going back to what I said earlier, while you search you scroll through potential matches wondering \"How many of these people are being told that I'm viewing them?\" My guess is every last one. This app seems to have found various loopholes to make you feel as though you are/will be receiving attention when that's simply not the case.

This section is not intended to limit your rights as a consumer or your right to bring an action in your country of residence, to the extent such rights cannot be changed by this Agreement.\r\n\r\n        Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree that any claim or dispute you may have against Zoosk must be resolved in a federal or state court located in Santa Clara County, California, USA or as described in the Arbitration provision below. Both you and Zoosk retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Santa Clara County, California, USA is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or in the event that the Arbitration provision below is for any reason held to be unenforceable.\r\n\r\n        Arbitration. READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM ZOOSK. For any dispute with Zoosk, you agree to first contact us within 30 days of when the dispute arises at legal@zoosk.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Zoosk has not been able to informally resolve a dispute it has with you within 60 days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief described in Section 19(a)) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, Claims), by binding arbitration by the Judicial Mediation and Arbitration Services (JAMS) under the JAMS Optional Expedited Procedures then in effect, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com. You will have the right to participate in the selection of the arbitrator, who may be selected by mutual agreement of the parties or by the procedures provided by JAMS if the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator. Unless the parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator shall be an attorney licensed to practice in the location where the arbitration proceedings will be conducted or a retired federal or state judicial officer who presided in the jurisdiction where the arbitration will be conducted. The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California, USA, (or the nearest office to Santa Clara County), unless you request a hearing in your hometown area or you and Zoosk agree otherwise. The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings will be English, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. You will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing fees in accordance with JAMS rules. The award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorneys fees and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that partys data security, intellectual property rights, or other proprietary rights. You may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process.\r\n\r\n        If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Zoosk submit to the arbitrator and, if requested by either party or the arbitrator, a telephonic hearing.\r\n\r\n        CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER. YOU AND ZOOSK AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSONS CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND ZOOSK ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\r\n\r\n        Severability. If any clause within this Section 19 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this section and the remainder of the section will be given full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.\r\n\r\n        Except to the extent Zoosk is in breach of the terms of this Agreement, you shall be responsible for any losses, expenses or other costs incurred by Zoosk, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and each of their directors, officers, managers, agents, contractors, partners and employees due to or arising from\r\n\r\n            your use of or access to the Services, including any data or content transmitted or received by you, or your inability to use the Services;\r\n\r\n            any claim or damages that arise as a result of any of your User Content or any User Content that is submitted via your account that is in breach of this Agreement, our policies or any Additional Terms;\r\n\r\n            your conduct in connection with the Services or our users that is in breach of this Agreement, our policies or any Additional Terms;\r\n\r\n            your violation of any of the terms of this Agreement, including without limitation your breach of any of the statements you have agreed to in this Agreement;\r\n\r\n            your violation of any rights of a third party, including without limitation any right of privacy or intellectual property rights;\r\n\r\n            any other partys access and use of the Services with your unique username, password or other appropriate security code; or\r\n\r\n            your violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations.\r\n    TERMINATION\r\n\r\n    Unless otherwise provided, this Agreement is effective upon your first use of the Services and shall remain in effect until it is terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\r\n\r\n        Termination by Zoosk. Zoosk may suspend, deactivate or terminate your account and your right to use the Services and may block or prevent your access to and use of the Services at any time if you commit a breach the terms of this Agreement, in Zoosks discretion. In particular and without limitation, if you breach the terms of clauses 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12 and 15 we may terminate this agreement.\r\n\r\n        We may also terminate this Agreement by giving you notice.\r\n\r\n        We may remove or block access to your account information, User Content or data from our Services and any other records at any time in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\r\n\r\n        In the event that your access to any of the Services is terminated or suspended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, you agree that all fees then paid to Zoosk by you will be nonrefundable, except as otherwise provided by law. All decisions relating to refunds of the fees are at Zoosk's discretion.\r\n\r\n        Termination by You. You may deactivate or terminate your account at any time, for any or no reason, by accessing the \"settings\" page of your account or by contacting us as described above. If you deactivate or terminate your account before the expiry of your subscription, please see clause 12(e). Except as otherwise provided by law or under this Agreement, you will not be entitled to any refund of the fees you have paid to Zoosk. All decisions relating to refunds of the fees are at Zoosk's discretion.\r\n\r\n        Survival. After your account is suspended, deactivated or terminated, all terms that by their nature may survive termination of this Agreement shall be deemed to survive such termination, including without limitation Sections 17, 18, 19 and 21.\r\n    MISCELLANEOUS\r\n\r\n    This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted in this Agreement, may not be transferred by you without Zoosks consent, but may be transferred by Zoosk without restriction.\r\n\r\n    Zoosk intends to rely on the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any Additional Terms as setting out the written terms of our relationship with you unless we have both agreed to a separate written agreement between us that expressly governs over this Agreement.\r\n\r\n    If any provision of this Agreement is illegal or otherwise unenforceable, this shall not affect the rest of this Agreement or the Additional Terms.\r\n\r\n    Other than any entities that Zoosk owns a 50% or greater interest in, or as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, there are no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement and no third party who is not a party to this Agreement shall have any right to enforce any term of this Agreement.\r\n\r\n    If you do not comply with this Agreement and we do not take action immediately, this does not mean that we have given up any rights that we may take action in the future.\r\n    LANGUAGE OF THE AGREEMENT\r\n\r\n    The language of this Agreement is English.\r\n\r\n    Where Zoosk has provided a translation of the English version of this Agreement, you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language version of this Agreement will govern your relationship with Zoosk.\r\n\r\n    If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of this Agreement says and what a translation says, then the English language version will take precedence.", "picture_urls": null}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "3.8", "reviewed_at": "05/05/2014", "review_title": "\u201cI never signed up for this site or even knew it existed...\u201d", "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "John\u00a0S.", "absolute_url": "https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/zoosk.com?page=103", "website_name": ["Sitejabber Online Business Reviews and Complaints"], "review_text": "I never signed up for this site or even knew it existed until I saw $75.00 was taken from my checking account by them.

I'm posting it anyway because I've written it already. \r\n\r\nWhat gets me is why hasn't the main stream media outed this yet? This would be a great Dateline investigation piece.\r\n\r\nThere are two main indicators that Zoosk is a largely fraud-operation running scam:\r\n\r\n1. Is the monumental disparity between the amount of messages/attention/potential (fake) profiles you are presented with before you pay, and the complete lack of all aforementioned AFTER you pay. \r\n\r\nIf the amount of attention a user account with no profile information or even a picture gets 10 emails in it's first week, with no profile and a picture, then how is it that once the profile is filled out and a picture is uploaded those magic emails suddenly drop to nothing. \r\nDoes Zoosk really think people believe that people are so desperate that they've resorted to spending their daily time on Zoosk writing emails to and wanting to meet someone based solely on a username and an age? Also, how dumb does Zoosk think that people are to believe that people are really interested in contacting completely un-filled-out empty profiles, when there are thousands of already filled-out profiles are at their disposal?\r\nIf after you've paid, you can barely get a person to read your email, if a person who is willing to reach out to a completely unknown stranger for no apparent reason, then critical *critical* logic should follow that they are literally willing to accept ANYTHING as a real match. \r\n\r\n2. They rely heavily on faked feedback loops. Feedback loops are when you get a \"Like\" or a \"Comment\" on Facebook. It keeps you coming back for more. Zoosk relies heavily on this pseudo-psychological element to whet your appetite. At first they'll flood your completely empty un-filled-out profile with people who are interested, then interest drops dramatically after you fill out your profile. \"What happened? Did people just decided that they didn't like me?? I have to investigate. I need to reach out to more people!\" - proceeds to contact 300 profiles. Unintentional or otherwise, this is how it works out there.\r\n\r\nThese are things that keep people coming back to the site: \"Did someone like or reply to my email?\" Zoosk manufactures a ton of feedback loops saying, \"A person has viewed your profile.\"\r\n\r\nEveryone has to \"view\" whichever/whatever profile Zoosk decides to throws in their face. It's literally not an indicator of anything. If anything else, they saw your picture and thought they'd look at your profile based on age and location, since that's the only thing they have to go on anyway.\r\n\r\nIf you do the \"Search\" option, you are automatically presented with profiles, which you are now viewing. How Zoosk decides if what constitutes as a \"view\" is anyone's guess, but they've now turned you into \"a potentially interested person.\"\r\n\r\nThese are not true indicators of any kind of real interest, especially if they're not followed up by any kind of real follow-ups. Zoosk feeds people's false hopes by telling people that people have viewed their profiles. What's worse is I think that there are probably some poor souls out there who actually believe that this is some standard way of flirting on Zoosk, and think that people are just being coy or playing hard to get. \"I need to pursue this person harder! Oh! I know! I will buy them a gift!\" \r\nI wonder how many real matches resulted from some poor schmuck chunking out coins on gifts resulted in an actual date. \r\n\r\nIt's very common knowledge that guys who buy women things first, convey that they have no value and have to spend money in order to get women's attention. What's even more cheesy is the flip side of that, is if after you've gotten to know a girl on Zoosk and you buy her one of those one-bit cheapo digital gifts, then you really seem bogus. If you've gotten to know her, dude, show some originality. Buy her a REAL GIFT. Not some cheesy dating site unoriginal term of endearment. Some girls say they like guys to buy them a drink and some are telling the truth, but to be quite honest it's more of a test to see if you're \"just another one of those guys who'll just buy me things.\"", "picture_urls": null}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "1.0", "reviewed_at": "04/04/2014", "review_title": "\u201clike a fool paid up for 6 months .they are bloody useless...\u201d", "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "fred\u00a0n.", "absolute_url": "https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/zoosk.com?page=103", "website_name": ["Sitejabber Online Business Reviews and Complaints"], "review_text": "like a fool paid up for 6 months .they are bloody useless . now how does one get their money back? has any one had success. been on a week supposed to have had140 odd views , tried repeatably to contact people no such luck. how in gods name do they get away with it. take a thousand prats like me paying 70 quid every six months good earner hey , how many thousands have done the same.

He states in his profile, he is a Christian, and tells a sob story about his ex taking his five-year-old girl away and that is why he moved to the United States, to get a new start. He claims he is a civil engineer, and two days after we started communicating online, he says he has an overseas job in Spain for six weeks. At first, everything was going well with his job, and that he may come back December 7. Then, a week or so later, he says his tourist ticket is on December 14. He complains of the cold weather in Spain and says he misses me. States he has a condo in Sarasota, Florida - but there are no property records of the purchase. He asked me to call him in Spain. We talked a little more than a week. The last few days, he started to hint at work difficulties, that there was not enough money, that he needed $2000 from his account in Florida. But he didn't trust his friends, and he has no family. \r\n\r\nI was going to send him a handwritten letter but he refused to give me his hotel or his home address in Florida. After that, I think he felt he \"hooked\" me, and started to ask if I could ask others for money for him. Then he asked me directly, saying he is normally a very proud man, and it hurts to beg.\r\n\r\nI blocked his numbers so he can't call me anymore. Asking for money is such a red flag. I hope no other woman falls for this scheme. He did what other dating scam websites said, he did direct me to start chatting on Yahoo Messenger instead of Zoosk.\r\n\r\nHe called me from a different number a few days ago.  First, buttering me up, then the next day, pretending to be angry at my Zoosk review.  I took it down, still wanting to believe this fantasy.  But I've reposted it to warn others of this fake.  And I blocked his number again.\r\n\r\nI have talked to others, and they have had similar experiences.  A Jamaican man living in Philadelphia, and then when my friend wanted to meet, he hesitated and made excuses.  He, too, switched her to chatting on Yahoo Messenger.\r\n\r\nOverall, it seems the quality of profiles are less than a couple free sites.  Oh, and Zoosk will only take down a profile if there is something overtly offensive.  Otherwise, they have to keep it posted.  I had some difficulty unsubscribing from the website also.

Oh, get this.  The system periodically matches people up by common attitudes then makes you pay to connect with this great person for you.  As an experiment, I used 20 coins (which can also be accrued by participating in one of their sham surveys) to email said great match who Zoosk confirmed had also expressed an interest in meeting me.....and nothing.  No response whatsoever.  However, I was given the option to invest another 20 coins to determine whether or not my email had been read yet.  What a crock!!!  Not to overstate my value, but I'm generally considered to be quite attractive and have a well written, interesting bio of my own. Funny, before I signed up for the paid membership, I used the Search function to see who might live in my vicinity & there were many choices.  Suddenly, in a single day - since I paid - their profiles have all magically disappeared.  The saving grace here is the fact that I requested a temporary number from my credit card provider in case Zoosk were to attempt to bill me beyond the 30 day membership I signed up for.  Also, I enrolled over the phone rather than online specifically so I could tell the rep that I absolutely would not join unless the $35 new membership was waived & the the account NOT auto-renewed at the end of the month.

This was more of an experiment than anything else so my hopes were not high and I'm glad I didn't have high hopes.  I paid to be a member, $100 for I think 6-months.  I'm from NY.  First, I approached all the women in a very respectable way, Hi, my name is so-and-so, these are my hobbies / interests, what's yours?  1 out of 50 times I get a response which is pretty bad.  I get many views, but no one chats.  I did send a blast to 10 women asking them to give me a simple \"k\" to let me know the chat feature is working and two responded so I know it works.  I think the women / profiles are all legit but they are inundated with others guys or have already established chats with other guys.  Women who do not join, which I think most are not members, have limited chat / messaging features - limited as in they can respond to a message 10 times or something like that.  So women are even more picky on who they chat with.  The other downside is, the women I see are mostly divorced with kids.  Here's my estimate: 60% have kids living with them / divorced / starting over, 10% are ugly (sorry), 10% are in their 20s and 30s, and 20% are older than 30 (some are in nice shape).  A lot of the women are looking for a serious relationship.  I use this site as a test for my come-on lines and to build the nerve to hit on a hot girl in the real world.  It's also interesting to see the background on some women and how they were treated.   Some have massive chips on their shoulders.  It's also interesting to see them describe themselves - nice, easy going, low maintenance - okay, then why hasn't some guy picked you up?  My recommendation is, unless you have $100 to blow, it's not worth it.  If you've got the cash then this might be a fun thing as an aside to do but you should be actively finding a live girl in the real world.  I think of this almost like fishing, I put out 100 lines.

I had accumulated 3 pages of blocked (fake) users and I would still come across a profile I'd reported multiple times in the past in my searches. They ban you for putting your email address in your profile, but post a cropped image of an attractive pornstar and they don't fact check in the slightest.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is the Zoosk Scientific match, and Carousel. Which is where the micro-transactions come in.\r\nZoosk will regularly send you emails about a \"scientific match\" which just means, \"You're Christian? SHE'S Christian! You smoke? SHE smokes! You guys should totally hook up!\" If you agree to the match and she does too, she becomes your \"Mutual Match\" which must be unlocked with \"Zoosk coins\" a fake currency that you have to pay real money for, or sign up for spam, surveys, and other garbage to obtain. Carousel works the same way.\r\n\r\nSo after all this bs you're left much poorer with scarcely a lady in sight. With terrible moderation, horrid pricing, and fake users galore stay away from these rip-off experts. Just do Plenty of Fish. There may be fake users, and scam artists on that site too, but at least I can get the same \"benefits\" of Zoosk minus the price of admission.", "picture_urls": null}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "2.6", "reviewed_at": "01/04/2013", "review_title": "\u201ccouldn't get messenger to work right\u201d", "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "Michael\u00a0P.", "absolute_url": "https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/zoosk.com?page=110", "website_name": ["Sitejabber Online Business Reviews and Complaints"], "review_text": "couldn't get messenger to work right. terrible pay structure isn't worth 5.00 month let a loan 20", "picture_urls": null}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "2.4", "reviewed_at": "22/03/2013", "review_title": "\u201cHorrible payment structure if you actually plan to...\u201d", "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "Alex\u00a0B.", "absolute_url": "https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/zoosk.com?page=110", "website_name": ["Sitejabber Online Business Reviews and Complaints"], "review_text": "Horrible payment structure if you actually plan to try to message someone and an otherwise clunky UI. only redeeming factor is that i could delete my account.", "picture_urls": null}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "2.3", "reviewed_at": "14/03/2013", "review_title": "\u201cWhat a surprise!

The System has been very unreliable in access and use, and apparently there are no checks on validity of the subscribers.  \r\n\r\nI see what I believe to be several devious business tactics in the operation of zoosk sites. You keep getting pop-up messages all the time (even after paying for premium membership) which are trying to compile information from you for marketing purposes, such as demanding a Cell Phone number for some supposed service while moving between screens on the system. \r\n\r\nAs I tried to unsubscribe in disgust, I was first forced into a Marketing Survey that posed only questions which would be thought of as \"Positive statistics\" for Zoosk. As a network admin and web dev I find this very underhanded and distasteful in a business process. Zoosk also doesn't give you a obvious means of cancelling out of these Screens, hitting esc does nothing, as a user you have to guess that just clicking somewhere else on the web screen closes the scam pop-up zoosk marketing screens.\r\n\r\nI noticed that after I cancelled my account I was informed that I would still have access to my account until the end of the month (term I had already paid for), however when I tried to access my account I noticed it had been disabled, the same account login name and password I used previously would no longer work. I also noticed that after trying to cancel my account, I was suddenly blasted with all sorts of emails from Zoosk about scientific matches and hits, which appeared to me to be an automated process by zoosk in an attempt to lure me back to it's paid services. The appearance that you are suddenly getting a \"bunch\" of responses and hits while at the same time being unable to access your account during this last month termination period, seems to me an attempt to frustrate a person back into purchasing the service.

Strange, I received a bunch of emails from women even before I had a photo up.

I have seen it so many times before.  Oh yeah, they have been delinquent in answering my customer service questions.  I even saw on a blog that a certain member had \"just subscribed\" to Zoosk - this same member having sent me an email.  One day later, her message and profile were gone.

In my case I have my daughter 50% of the time which leaves plenty of time for dating without having to bring her into the equation. This is actually a pretty big deal that they essentially are forcing people with kids to say they either live with or without them 100% of the time because not only does it paint an inaccurate picture, but it can significantly reduce a person's marketability by giving the impression that their kid is connected to their hip at all times. \r\n\r\nSo I finish my profile and on the main home page what do I see? Status updates of unattractive men and then....OMG!!!! I kid you not... on the home page I see a pic of a big hard....umm you can use your imagination. Real classy huh? \r\n\r\nThe good news? I have had 7 men email/wink at me in the 35 minutes I have been signed up. The bad news?  If me and any one of these guys were the last ones on earth and the survival of the species depended on my having to have procreate with them, let's just say \"Sorry human kind\". \r\n\r\nOh and another thing, this is one of those \"free sites\" that limits you in terms of the interaction you can have with people unless you spend money.
