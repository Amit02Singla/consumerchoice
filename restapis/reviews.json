During the short trial period EVPN seemed to be work fine. But once I got overseas, the proverbial crap hit the fan. When EVPN worked, my machines were very slow. And the connection would fail every few minutes. Even though I never connected the VPN kill-switch, when the VPN was down and struggling to connect, I couldnt connect to the Internet at all. It was so consistently bad that Internet use became unpredictable. I actually had to return to the US after only 6 months BECAUSE I couldnt do my work. Others who were using EVPN throughout the country were experiencing the same problem. \n\nNow Im back in the States and EVPN still throughout the day fails. Its typical for me to look at its icon in my system tray and see its NOT connected, obviating the very protection Im paying for. And its worse on my mobile phone. Its CONSTANTLY down. And when its active, my phone is so slow I cant load even just a webpage. \n\nWorst of all, the company doesnt care about these experiences. When you contact customer support, you get the same insipid trouble shooting instructions. If you try to tell them youve tried the steps before without any improvement, theyll tell you you havent. Then when you send them the files showing that youve already done what theyve instructed, the communication will go dead. \n\nAnd Ive tried EVERY server, but Netflix eventually denies them all despite EVPNs claim you can use them with Netflix. I have trouble using EVPN with other sites, too, like Craigslist. \n\nHow does this company keep turning up as the #1 VPN provider? Either their competitors are even worse or EVPN pays review companies for biased assessments.", "picture_urls": null, "website_name": ["Sitejabber Online Business Reviews and Complaints"]}, {"absolute_url": "https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/expressvpn.com", "rating": "3.5", "review_title": "\u201cUsed up 1-100% of CPU (doing what?) in background\u201d", "reviewed_at": "30/03/2018", "reviewer_name": "elliott\u00a0a.", "category": "Hosting Service", "service_name": "Bluehost", "review_text": "Service itself was as advertised, however:\r\nI detected over 100% CPU usage (from overclocking) by programme \"expressvpnd\".

The features that I wanted in a VPN service was: proper privacy, simultaneous use on multiple devices, nice Windows interface with low system resource usage, Android app, torrenting allowed and can't remember anything more.\r\nWhat I like about expressvpn the most is that's it's pretty speedy and it has servers all around the world. The Windows client supports the usual VPN protocols including OpenVPN which is great.\r\nWhat I dislike about expressvpn is that it loses connection fairly often and because the official Windows client doesn't have a kill-switch featurethis is a privacy risk. The Windows client does it's job well, but it does have some annoying bugs (easy fixable though). And most of the time my upload speed is extremely low while connected to a VPN server, I'm not sure what the problem is but I'm thinking that the built-in NAT firewall is causing this.\r\nhttp://www.expressvpnreviewz.com/", "picture_urls": null, "website_name": ["Sitejabber Online Business Reviews and Complaints"]}, {"absolute_url": "https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/expressvpn.com?page=2", "rating": "5.0", "review_title": "\u201cMy Experiance about ExpressVPN through mostsecurevpn.com\u201d", "reviewed_at": "04/06/2015", "reviewer_name": "Mark\u00a0S.", "category": "Hosting Service", "service_name": "Bluehost", "review_text": "Torrenting and many other website are blocked in my country.
