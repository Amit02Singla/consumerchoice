When more people use, and after they have stopped, and Godaddy just helps them auto-renew without consent, they treat silence as consent, but sometimes people miss the email. How can they make the default decision? Yes, go daddy might be good for some people, but the way they work to grab more profits just reflects badly on the company culture and it makes me very disappointed. I have learnt to be more stringent with all these approvals. Thank you godaddy, for teaching me this lesson. Well, I go to college and i pay for it, I come here and I also pay for it. But you can be sure that, I wouldn't pay for it again, and I'll make sure none of my friends will be part of your quarterly profits.

OK, I'm going to try and press through. I have websites at GoDaddy no problem. OK, I can attach the name, but no way to know their exact nameserver is for the site.\r\nOK, now I have a front page on the reseller site. Can't change a thing. No FTP address to get new files up. This is a problem, right? So, I need to call support for this right? OK, listen to this.\r\nGoDaddy has a support number on their website, a single number. Now when you call that number it may or not be the number you need to talk to. I called the number and they had to send me to the reseller support dept.. OK, that was fine the day before. Yesterday, I called the same number, somebody picked up the phone and hung up. OK, maybe I made a mistake I'll try again. I call the number again and a Chinese sounding guy picks up the phone and says wrongs number. OK I am a fast learner calling this number is not going to get me anywhere. So, I search and find an email address.\r\nI email them and I write as precisely as I can, the problems and issues I have so that at least they would know what to address. I get an email back telling me I should call this number. No attempt to address the issues in the email. OK, this is the way it goes. So, I call the new number and it tells me the voice mail box has not been setup. WTF?\r\nLike I said I am a fast learned and now me and GoDaddy and the Reseller BS are done. Finished. I feel like a dope because I am thinking they are all top notch.\r\nWhy this is important, #1 if you enter the URL I attached to the site you get a blank space. Now there is a website, it is up and running, so what's the URL to get to it? Don't ask me I have no idea and I own it.\r\nI went through and jacked up the prices just for fun knowing most people not paying anything like that. Here is the thing, suppose some business buys up on a jacked-up price site and accessories, and then it craps out on them, and then they get support like I got. Who is going to get sued? Me, that's who, so I went back and globally reset all the prices, because I have zero control on anything dealing with that reseller site. I paid and have no idea how to administrate or operate it. I've already determined it is a loss, but I'm going to try and get refund, but I have no optimism on that.\r\nSo, if my story helps anybody contemplating being an entrepreneur with a GoDaddy reseller site, please, think twice.

I have written them many times (never got an answer) and called their tech support many many times and my comments and suggestions seem to fall on deaf ears. If you have a site where you use very few photos and also change them infrequently, this might not be an issue. But if you DO like to have lots of images and switch them out frequently - STAY AWAY from these products!!!\r\n\r\nAfter this last time of trying to take off 20 photos and switch to new ones and it taking me almost an hour to delete the old photos, I have really had ENOUGH. With sites like Facebook allowing you to quickly upload, delete, switch around, move photos into albums and find them quickly - including photos that are actually text (pdfs) and SEE what they say - I do not and will not ever understand a web building service that does not allow these basic functions!! NO albums, so if you have say, 100+ photos, it is impossible to organize them.\r\n\r\nNot only that, but to find a photo that has been uploaded, say, to move it to another place on your site or delete it, scrolling down through the Photo Browser keeps popping the browser up to the top - MANY MANY times until you are finally able to scroll down far enough. Once you have scrolled down, then you can only access ONE photo. If you want another from the former photos, you can not choose more than one, so you have to repeat this whole scrolling thing, where the browser brings you back to the top many times, before you can finally access the photo that was maybe next to the one you just selected or moved. No batch selecting.\r\n\r\nYou also can not view the Browser photos in anything but a very small thumbnail. So if say, you have a number of pdfs with the same general format and that are in text, you are unable to differentiate one from the other. In my case, I have pedigrees of my cats that in thumbnail format all look the same. It is impossible to choose one, based on the text content. So I find myself uploading the same pdf images over and over again - simply because I can not SEE them, they are too small to read.\r\n\r\nThen again, you are unable to keep any images in folders, such as certain products or categories (T-shirts, cotton shirts or whatever have you).\r\n\r\nWorking with images within the Website Builder or Go Central is practically impossible and VERY VERY frustrating!! Even more frustrating is GoDaddy's complete disregard for listening to customers on these issues - and these services are EXPENSIVE!!! I'm sure I am not the only customer who deals with a lot of images on their site!!

Try another theme, still problems. Call billing for refund, but by now fell out of 30 days by 5 days. No refund from billing, so I asked to speak to Supervisor in Billing and I got Chris. Chris says no refund and starts asking me why I didn't do this, do that all these ideas of what I should have tried. Of course, technical support offered none of these ideas when I was within the 30 days and calling about the problems. Chris states while they do have situations where they give refunds outside of 30 days he will not give it here because that would be like trying to return a car because you don't know how to drive. So rude, condescending and unacceptable. I told him in good faith we had called and called and tech support offered nothing as to work arounds or even other ways to work that could have helped us. I stated again and again that the service did not work, the layout was faulty and it was not a straightforward user error in our case. After placing me on hold for 45 minutes because I felt they were being unfair as we were very close to the 30 days and they had a record that we had been calling in beforehand about the problem (he did check in a few times to see if I had anything new to add) he ended up hanging up on me.

But the executive (girl) was quite dumb and could not justify and ended up saying that they have the same resource level setup for all the plans. Frankly speaking they charge almost the same amount as the hosting fee (one year) for resource level up-gradation which is not logical and feasible. The only benefit they show case is the number of emails they provide with each plans. Not every body require 500 emails, I mean what am I supposed to do with 500 and 1000 emails if I do not get bandwidth / physical memory upgraded with the respective plans.\r\n\r\nThe most vague thing is they never talk about resources prior to sales.
